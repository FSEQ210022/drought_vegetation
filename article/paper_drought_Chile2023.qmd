  Human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have increased the frequency and/or intensity of weather and climate extremes. Central Chile has been affected by a persistent drought which is impacting the hydrological system and vegetation development. The region has been the focus of research studies due to the diminishing water supply, this persistent period of water scarcity has been defined as a “mega drought". Nevertheless, our results evidence that the water deficit has expanded beyond. Our goal is to analyze the impact of drought, measured by drought indices of water supply/demand and vegetation status, in the LULCC (land use land cover change) over continental Chile.  For the analysis, continental Chile was divided into five zones according to a latitudinal gradient: “Norte Grande”,  “Norte Chico”,  “Zona Central”, “Zona Sur”, and “Zona Austral”.  We used monthly climatic re-analysis variables for precipitation, temperature and soil moisture for 1981-2023 from ERA5-Land; and MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) product MCD12Q1 for land cover for 2001-2021, and the NDVI vegetation index from product MOD13A2 collection 6.1 for 2000-2023, both from collection 6.1. We estimated atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) by combining the Hargreaves-Samani equation with the ERA5-Land temperature. We derived the drought indices SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index), SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index), EDDI (Evaporative Demand Drought Index), SSI (standardized anomaly of cumulative soil moisture), and the zcNDVI (standardized anomaly of cumulative NDVI). These indices were calculated for time scales of 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months, except for zcNDVI (1, 3, and 6 months). We analyzed the temporal correlation of SPI, SPEI, EDDI, and SSI with zcNDVI to have insights into the impact of water supply and demand on vegetation.   Our results showed that LULCC had an increasing trend of 412 [km2yr−1] of forest expansion in the “Zona Sur”, together with a  decreasing trend of 24 [km2yr−1] of cropland contraction in the “Zona Central” meanwhile the “Zona Sur” showed an increase of 31 [km2yr−1], and a contraction of 80 [km2yr−1] of bare soil in the “Zona Austral”. The EDDI was the less correlated index for the five macro zones and the five types of land cover, showing that the temperature in Chile has little impact on vegetation. Higher r-squared values, between 0.5 and 0.8, were obtained at “Norte Chico” and “Zona Central” for the land cover types of savanna, shrubland, grassland, and croplands for the indices SPEI and SSI at time scales of 12 and 24 months. The forest type reaches a r-squared of ~0.5 for SSI of 12 months. The results indicate that the “Norte Chico” and “Zona Central” are the most sensitive regions to water supply deficits longer than a year, potentially explained by a low capacity of water storage in those zones that should be further investigated.

# Introduction

The sixth assessment report (AR6) of the IPCC [@IPCC2023] indicates that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have increased the frequency and/or intensity of some weather and climate extremes, and the evidence has been strengthened since AR5 [@IPCC2013]. There is high confidence that increasing global warming can expand the land area affected by increasing drought frequency and severity [@IPCCCH112021]. Furthermore, drought increases tree mortality and triggers changes in land cover and, consequently, land use, thus impacting ecosystems [@Crausbay2017]. Nevertheless, there is a lack of understanding of how the alteration in water supply and demand is affecting land cover transformations.

Precipitation is the primary driver of drought and is intensified by temperature [@Luo2017]. Drought impacts soil moisture, hydrological regimes, and vegetation productivity. Initially, drought was commonly classified as meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural [@Wilhite1985]. Lately, @Loon2016 and @AghaKouchak2021 have given an updated definition of drought for the Anthropocene, suggesting that it should be considered the feedback of humans' decisions and activities that drives the anthropogenic drought. Even though it has been argued that those definitions do not fully address the ecological dimensions of drought. @Crausbay2017 proposed the ecological drought definition as *"an episodic deficit in water availability that drives ecosystems beyond thresholds of vulnerability, impacts ecosystem services, and triggers feedback in natural and/or human systems"*. Moreover, many ecological studies have misinterpreted how to characterize drought, for example, sometimes considering "dry" conditions as "drought" [@Slette2019]. On the other hand, the AR6 [@IPCC2023] states that even if global warming is stabilized at 1.5°–2°C, many parts of the world will be impacted by more severe agricultural and ecological droughts. Then, there is a challenge in conducting drought research, especially to evaluate its impact on ecosystems.

Chile has been facing a persistent rainfall deficit for more than a decade [@Garreaud2017], which has impacted vegetation development [@Zambrano2023] and the hydrological system [@Boisier2018]. Current drought conditions have affected crop productivity [@Zambrano2016; @Zambrano2018], forest development [@Miranda2020;@Venegas2018], forest fire occurrence [@UrrutiaJalabert2018], land cover change [@Fuentes2021], water supply in watersheds [@AlvarezGarreton2021], and have had economic impacts [@Fernandez2023]. In 2019–2020, the drought severity reached an extreme condition in Central Chile (30–34°S) not seen for at least 40 years, and the evidence indicates that the impact is transversal to the land cover classes of forest, grassland, and cropland [@Zambrano2023]. The prolonged lack of precipitation in Central Chile is producing changes in ecosystem dynamics that must be studied.

For the spatiotemporal assessment of drought impact (i.e., by water supply and demand) on land cover changes, we need climatic realiable variables such as precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, land cover, and vegetation status. For developing countries like Chile, the weather networks present several disadvantages, such as gaps, a short history, and low-quality data. Reanalysis data, as the ERA5-Land (ERA5L) [@MunozSabater2021] provides hourly climatic information (precipitation, temperature, and soil moisture) without gaps since 1950 with global extension. ERA5L has already been used for drought assessment using the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) [@Nouri2023] and for flash drought [@Wang2023] by analyzing soil mositure and evapotranspiration. On the other hand, satellite remote sensing [@West2019; @AghaKouchak2015] is the primary method to evaluate how drought impacts vegetation dynamics. Vegetation drought indices (VDI) are commonly used as proxies of productivity [@Paruelo2016; @Schucknecht2017], which can be derived from the MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer).  Besides, land use and land cover (LULC) change can be driven by drought [@Tran2019; @Akinyemi2021]. To analyze these changes, multiple LULC products exist [@Grekousis2015], one of those that provides time series since 2001 is the MCD12Q1 [@Friedl2019] from MODIS. The variation in water supply and demand is finally reflected in the total water storage (TWS). The TWS can be retrieved by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), which allows analyzing water availability changes at coarse resolution [@Ahmed2014; @Ma2017]. We can use climatic reanalysis (ERA5L) and vegetation data (MODIS) to derive drought indices of supply (i.e., precipitation) and demand (i.e., temperature) and thus evaluate the impact of drought on LULC changes. Further, the TWS can be assessed with regard to the changes in water supply and demand to gain insight into the impact on water storage.

To evaluate meteorological drought (i.e., water supply), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO; @WMO2012) recommends the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI; @Mckee1993), a multiscalar drought index that allows to monitor precipitation deficits from short- to long-term. Following the same approach, @Vicente-Serrano2010 incorporates into the SPI the effect of temperature through the use of potential evapotranspiration, thus proposing the SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index). Similarly, to evaluate solely the evaporative demand driven by temperature, @Hobbins2016 and @McEvoy2016 came up with the Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI). For vegetation, in a similar manner as the SPI, SPEI and EDDI; @Zambrano2018 proposed the zcNDVI, a standardized anomaly of the cumulative Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which could be acumulated over the growing season or any period (e.g., months), resulting in a multiscalar drought index. For soil moisture, several drought indices exist, such as the Soil Moisture Deficit Index (SDMI) a normalized index [@Narasimhan2005] and the Soil Moisture Agricultural Drought Index (SMADI) [@Souza2021] which is a normalized index using vegetation, land surface temperature, and a vegetation condition index (VCI, [@Kogan1995]). From TWS, we can estimate the standardized terrestrial water storage index (STI) [@Cui2021], a standardized anomaly that follows the methodology of the SPI, SPEI, EDDI, and zcNDVI. Thereby, we have drought indices for water supply, demand, and storage, which can help to make a comprehensive assessment of drought.

In this research, we present the raster dataset DDS4Chl, which provides climate variables and drought indices of water demand and supply and vegetation productivity for continental Chile since 1981 at a monthly frequency. Those were gathered from the earth observation products ERA5-Land and MODIS. Then, we used DDS4Chl to analyze the impact of drought on different types of land cover classes in continental Chile. The specific objectives of the study are: i) to analyze the trend on multi-scalar drought indices for water demand and supply, soil moisture, and vegetation productivity for 1981–2023/2001–2023; ii) to evaluate LULC change for 2001–2021 and its relation to drought indices; iii) to analyze the relationship of a proxy of vegetation productivity (zcNDVI) with drought indices of water demand and supply and soil moisture; and iv) to assess if the observed changes in the drought indices are linked to TWS.

# Study area

Continetal Chile has a diverse climate condition from north to south and east to west [@Aceituno2021] (@fig-studyArea), which determines its great ecosystem diversity (@fig-LCprop). The Andes Mountains are a main factor in latitudinal variation [@Garreaud2009]. To describe the climate and ecosystem of Chile, we use the Koppen-Geiger release by @Beck2023 and the landcover type persistance of 80% of times for 2001–2022, from the IGBP classification scheme [@Friedl2019] (see @sec-methods_lulc). "Norte Grande" and "Norte Chico" predominate in an arid desert climate with hot (Bwh) and cold (Bwk) temperatures. At the south of "Norte Chico," the climate changes to an arid steppe with cold temperatures (Bsk). Mainly, the land is barren, with a minor surface of vegetation types such as shrubland and grassland. In the zones "Centro" and the north half of "Sur," the main climate is Mediterranean, with warmer to hot summers (Csa and Csb). In "Centro," there is a major proportion (~50%) of chilean matorral (shrubland and savanna, [@Fuentes2021]), followed by grassland (~16%), forest (8%), and croplands (5%). The south part of "Centro" and the north part of "Austral" are dominated by an Oceanic climate (Cfb). Those zones are high in forest and grassland. The southern part of the country has a tundra climate, and in Patagonia, it is a cold semi-arid area with an extended surface of grassland.

# Materials and Methods

## Software and packages used

For the downloading, processing, and analysis of the spatio-temporal data, we used the open source software for statistical computing and graphics, `R` [@R2023]. For downloading ERA5-Land, we used the `{ecmwfr}` package [@Hufkens2019]. For processing raster data, we used `{terra}` [@Hijmans2023] and `{stars}` [@Pebesma2023]. For managing vectorial data, we used `{sf}` [@Pebesma2018]. For the calculation of AED, we used `{SPEI}` [@Bergueria2023].

##	Data

###	Earth observation data

For water supply and demand variables, we used ERA5-Land [@MunozSabater2021], a reanalys dataset that provides the evolution of land variables since 1950. It has a spatial resolution of 0.1°, hourly frequency, and global coverage. We selected the variables for total precipitation, 2 meter temperature maximum and minimum, and volumetric soil water layers between 0 and 100cm of depth (layer 1 to layer 3). The data was downloaded using the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) Application Program Interface (API) implemented in `{ecmfwr}` [@Hufkens2019].

To derive a proxy of vegetation productivity, we used the product MOD13A3 collection 6.1 from MODIS [@Didan2015]. It provides vegetation indices (NDVI and EVI) at 1km of spatial resolution and monthly frequency. The MOD13A3.061 and MCD12Q1.061 were retrieved from the online Data Pool, courtesy of the NASA EOSDIS Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC), USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, https://lpdaa.usgs.gov/tools/data-pool/.

###	in-situ data

## Drought Indices

We derived the drought indices of water supply and demand, soil moisture from the ERA5-Land dataset, and vegetation from the MODIS product, all at monthly frequency.

For the indices EDDI and SPEI that use water demand, first we have to calculate the AED. For this, we used the method of Hargreaves [@Hargreaves1994]:

$$AED = 0.0023\cdot Ra\cdot (T+17.8)\cdot (T_{max}-T_{min})^{0.5}$$ {#eq-AED}

where $Ra$ $(MJ\,m^2\, day^{-1})$ is extraterrestrial radiation; $T$, $T_{max}$, and $T_{min}$ are mean, maximum, and minimum temperature $(°C)$. We calculate the centroid coordinates per pixel and use the latitude to estimate $Ra$.

To evaluate water demand, we chose the $EDDI$ [@Hobbins2016; @McEvoy2016] index, which uses the $AED$. For supply, we used the index recommended by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) for monitoring drought, the SPI [@Mckee1993]. We calculated the SPEI, which used a balance between $P$ and $AED$, in this case, an auxiliary variable $D = P-AED$ is used. In this study, we used the $SSI$ (standardized soil moisture index at 1 m) [@Hao2013;@AghaKouchak2014], which uses SM. Finally, for the proxy of productivity, $zcNDVI$, we used the NDVI. Before using the NDVI, it was smoothed following the procedure described in @Zambrano2018 and @Zambrano2016.

All the indices are multi-scalar and were calculated for time scales of 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months, except for zcNDVI, which was calculated for 6 months. The goal is to be able to evaluate short- and long-term droughts in water demand and supply and soil moisture. This is particularly important for central Chile because it has suffered from a prolonged decrease in precipitation for more than 12 years [@Garreaud2020;@Boisier2018;@Garreaud2017].

To calculate the drought indices, first we must calculate the accumulation of the variable. In this case, for generalization purposes, we will use $V$, referring to $P$, $AED$, $D$, $NDVI$, and $SM$ (Table \ref{tab-desEOD}). We cumulated each $V$ over the time series of $n$ values, and for the time scales $s$:

$$A_{si} = \sum_{i=n-s-i+2}^{n-i+1} V_i\,\, \forall\, i\geq n-s+1  $$ {#eq-sumvar}

It corresponds to a moving window (convolution) that sums the variable for $s$ starting for the last month $n$ until the month, which could sum for $s$ months (n-s+1). Once the variable is cumulated over time for the scale $s$, we used a nonparametric approach following @Hobbins2016 to derive the drought indices. Thus, the empirically derived probabilities are obtained through an inverse normal approximation [@Abramowitz1968]. Then, we used the empirical Tukey plotting position [@Wilks2011] over $A_i$ to derive the $P(A_i)$ probabilities across a period of interest:

$$P(A_i) = \frac{i-0.33}{n+0.33'}$$ {#eq-probPai}

The drought indices $SPI$, $SPEI$, $EDDI$, $SSI$, and $zcNDVI$ are obtained following the inverse normal approximation:

$$DI(A_i) = W - \frac{C_0+C_1\cdot W + c_2 \cdot W^2}{1+d_1\cdot W +d_2\cdot W^2 +d_3\cdot W^3}$$ {#eq-DI}

$DI$ is referring to the drought index calculated for the variable $V$. The values for the constats are: $C_0 = 2.515517$, $C_1 = 0.802853$, $C_2 = 0.010328$, $d_1 = 1.432788$, $d_2 = 0.189269$, and $d3 = 0.001308$. For $P(A) \leq 0.5$, W=$\sqrt{-2\cdot ln(P(A_i))}$ , and for $P(A_i) > 0.5$, replace $P(A_i)$ with $1-P(A_i)$ and reverse the sign of $DI(A_i)$.

##	LULC change for 2001-2022 and its relation with water supply and demand, and soil moisture {#sec-methods_lulc}

```

To analyze the LULCC, we use the IGBP scheme from the MCD12Q1 collection 6.1 from MODIS. This product has a yearly frequency from 2001 to 2022. The IGBP defines 17 classes; from these, we regrouped into ten macroclasses for forest, schrublands, savannas, grasslands, wetlands, croplands, urban, snow and ice, barren, and water bodies. To validate the IGBP MODIS, we compare the macroclasses with the ones of a more detailed landcover map made by @Zhao2016 for Chile for the years 2013–2014 (LCChile). The later has a spatial resolution of 30 m and three levels of defined classes; from those, we used level 1, which fits with the macroclasses derived from the IGBP MODIS. We chose the years 2013 and 2014 from MODIS IGBP because the LCChile was made with data acquired in 2013 and 2014. We resampled LCChile to the spatial resolution of the IGBP MODIS using the nearest neighbor method. Then, we took a random sample of 1000 points within continental Chile and extracted the classes that fell within each point for LCCHILE, IGP2013, and IGBP2014. Finally, we applied a confusion matrix and estimated the accuracy and F1 score as metrics of performance. The validation of IGBP2013 and IGBP2014 with LCChile reached similar metrics of performance, having an accuracy of 0.82 and a F1 score of 0.66 (see SS1). 

Later, with the goal of analyzing vegetation areas less affected by landcover change, we calculated a raster mask for IGBP MODIS considering the classes that remain for more than 80% of the years (2001–2022), which allows us to identify the areas with no landcover change for the macroclasses. @fig-LCprop shows the summary of the proportion of surface per landcover class and macrozone, derived from the mask over continental Chile. 

Further, we calculated the surface occupied per landcover class into the five macrozones ("Norte Grande" to "Austral") per year. After that, we calculated the trend's change in surface; we used the Sen' slope [@Sen1968] based on Mann-Kendall [@Kendall1975]. This way, we obtain a matrix of trends of 5 x 5 (macrozones x landcover).

We will explore if the trend in landcover classess is associated to trend of the drought indices. For this we will use the regularizations techniques of Lasso [@Tibshirani2010] and Ridge regressión [@Hoerl1970]. Also, we will test random forest for this purpose [@Ho1995].

## Trend of drought indices for water demand and supply, soil moisture, and vegetation productivity

To estimate if there are significant positive or negative trends for the drought indices, we used the non-parametric test of Mann-Kendall [@Kendall1975]. To determine the magnitude of the trend, we used Sen's slope [@Sen1968]. One of the advantages of applying this methodology is that the Sen's slope is not affected by outliers as regular regression does. We applied both to the six time scales from 1981 to 2023 (monthly frequency) and the indices SPI, EDDI, SPEI, and SSI. In the case of zcNDVI (six months) was for 2000 to 2023. Thus, we have 31 trends. Also, we extracted the trend aggregated by macrozone and landcover class, obtaining a table of 31x5x5 (drought indices trends x macrozone x landcover class). We will use this data in @sec-methods_lulc to analyze if there is a strong relationship between the trends of drought indices and land cover surface within continental Chile.

For zcNDVI, we want to remove the effect of the Andes's mountain and mask out trends that were at an elevation above 1500m because there is scarce vegetation.

@Vicente-Serrano2021 made a global analysis of the drought's severity trend using SPI, SPEI, and the Standardized Evapotranspiration Deficit Index (SEDI; @Vicente-Serrano2018) to evaluate AED. They indicate that the increase in hydrological drought has been due to anthropogenic effects rather than climate change. This is because the global increase in AED did not explain the change in the spatial pattern of the hydrological drought. Also, they state that _"the increase in hydrological droughts has been primarily observed in regions with high water demand and land cover change"_. We will contrast this hypothesis with what is occurring in Chile. To achieve this, we will use the landcover class type that remains more than 80% of types for 2001–2022 to evaluate the trend on zcNDVI and use this as a mask where there are low changes.

##	Impact for water supply and demand, and soil moisture in vegetation productivity within landcover types

The aim of this section is to analyze the drought indices of water demand and supply and soil moisture against vegetation to address: i) if short- or long-term time scales are most important in impacting vegetation through Chile; and ii) the strength of the correlation for the variable and the time scale. Then, we will summarize for each landcover class and macrozone. Thus, we will be able to advance in understanding how climate is affecting vegetation, considering the impact on the five macroclasses: forest, cropland, grassland, savanna, and shrubland.

To assess how water demand and supply and soil moisture are related to vegetation productivity (zcNDVI), we analyze the linear correlation between the indices SPI, SPEI, EDDI, and SSI for 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36-month time scales against zcNDVI. We followed a similar approach to that used by @Meroni2016 when using the SPI for meteorological drought against the cumulative FAPAR (Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation) as a proxy for vegetation productivity. We made a pixel-to-pixel linear correlation analysis per index. First, we calculate the Pearson coefficient of correlation for the six time scales and let the time scale that reaches the maximum correlation be significant (p < 0.05). Then, we extracted the Pearson correlation value corresponding to the time scales that reached the maximum value. Thus, we derived two raster maps per index, the first with the time scales and the second with the correlation value.

<!-- ##	Total water storage and drought indices -->

<!-- Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) is defined as the total amount of water stored on land that includes any natural or artificial water bodies, such as groundwater, soil moisture, rivers, lakes, snowpack, ice, and biomass water [@Humphrey2023; @Deng2023]. TWS changes evidence the effects of multiple water fluxes on the hydrological cycle [@Deng2023]. These are reflected in the temporal variation of observations of the Earth's gravitational field [@Abolafia2021; @Sabzehee2023] and, in recent decades, the twin Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites and their Follow-On mission (GRACE-FO) have provided valuable results on globally distributed TWS anomalies [@Tapley2019; @Ferreira2023]. The GRACE mission was launched in March 2002 and was operational until October 2017 [@Ramjeawon2022]. Then its GRACE Follow-On successor was launched in May 2018 [@Landerer2020; @Yin2022]. The information provided by these satellites is used to construct monthly maps of the Earth's average gravity field, providing details of the movement of water masses or water mass anomaly estimates relative to the long-term average gravity field [@Humphrey2023; @Wahr2004]. -->

<!-- In this study, RL06.1_V3 GRACE mascon (mass concentration) monthly solutions were used, which are provided by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL-M, https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov). Each GRACE Tellus monthly grid at 0.5 degrees represents the deviation of surface mass for that month relative to a reference time average (2004-2009 baseline), which is subtracted from all other monthly grids to provide terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) [@Ramjeawon2022; @Yin2022]. This JPL-M version of the data employs a Coastal Resolution Improvement (CRI) filter that reduces signal leakage errors across coastlines [@NASA2019; @Wiese2016]. Although the mascon solutions greatly reduced leakage errors, a gain factor, which is used to enhance the spatial resolution, was applied to the dataset as recommended for hydrological studies [@Ramjeawon2022; @Yin2022]. The water storage and height anomalies are given in Equivalent Water Height or Thickness units (EWH, cm) [@Sabzehee2023], and their temporal resolution monthly is from April 2002 to May 2023. -->

##	LULC change for 2001-2022 and its relation with water supply and demand, and soil moisture

@fig-zcNDVI_var and \ref{tab-landcoverTrend} show that the macrozones with major LULCC for 2001-2022 were "Centro", "Sur", and "Austral" with 36%, 31%, and 34%, respectively. The "Norte Chico" shows an increase in barrend land of 111 $km^2 year^{-1}$ and a reduction in the class savanna -70 $km^2 year^{-1}$. In the "Centro" and "Sur" there are changes in the chilean matorral, with an important reduction in savanna (-136 to -318 $km^2 yr^{-1}$), and an increase in shrubland and grassland. Showing a change for more dense vegetation types. It appears to be a change from the surface occupied by cropland from the "Centro" to the "Sur." Also, there is a high increase in forest (397 $Km^2 yr^{-1}$) in the "Sur," replacing the savanna lost.

##	Trend of drought indices for water demand and supply, soil moisture, and vegetation productivity

Regarding vegetation productivity aggregated through the macrozones in the five landcover macroclasses. In "Norte Grande" there is a increase trend of 0.02 (z-index) per decade, related with types of grassland and shrubland. There is a negative trend in "Norte Chico" with -0.04  and "Centro" with -0.02 per decade. In the "Norte Chico," savanna (-0.05) has the lowest trend, and the rest of the types are around -0.04. In "Centro," shrubland reaches -0.06, followed by grassland with -0.05, and croplands and savanna have ~-0.01 per decade. This could be associated either with a reduction in vegetation surface, a decrease in biomass, or browning [@Miranda2023]. Vegetation reached its lowest values since the year 2019, reaching an extreme condition in early 2020 and 2022 in the "Centro" (Mega Drought). The "Sur" and "Austral" show a positive trend of around 0.016 per decade (@fig-zcNDVI_var). The area most affected by a negative trend in vegetation seems to be associated with the Chilean matorral [@Fuentes2021], despite the croplands being as severely impacted by drought as native vegetation does in "Norte Chico.".

Analyzing the water supply in the macrozones "norte chico," "central," and "sur," the SPI shows a decreasing trend that increases at longer time scales due to the prolonged reduction in precipitation. It reaches a trend of -0.056 (z-score) per decade (@fig-trendSPI) for time scales of 36 months. In the case of water demand, we analyze the EDDI. It shows a positive trend, caused by an increase in AED. The trend on EDDI reaches a maximum of 0.053 per decade in the macrozones "norte grande" and "norte chico" (@fig-trendEDDI). The behavior is similar to SPI, having close trends with opposite signs. Nevertheless, the spatial patterns are different. The maximum trend for SPI-36 is in "norte chico" and "zona central." For EDDI-36, the maximum trend is from "northe grande" to "zona central."

The correlation between zcNDVI-6 and drought indices shows that time scales higher than six months are predominant over continental Chile in explaining vegetation variability (@fig-corTimeScale). Pearson correlations between 0.6 and 0.9 are concentrated in the "norte chico" and "zona central" for SPI and SPEI. Soil moisture reached a correlation of 0.6–0.9 that extended north and south with respect to SPI.
