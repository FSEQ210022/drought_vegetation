  Human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have increased the frequency
  and/or intensity of some weather and climate extremes globally. Chile
  has been affected by persistent water scarcity which is impacting the
  hydrological system and vegetation development. Central Chile it is
  been the focus of research studies due to the diminishing water
  supply, nevertheless water deficit is expanded beyond. We analyze
  earth observation data for 2000-2023 to do a comprehensive assessment
  of water scarcity in Chile. For the analysis, continental Chile was
  divided into five zones from north to south. We used the time series
  of MODIS for land cover change (LULC), fraction of vegetation cover
  (FVC), and to derive the drought index zcNDVI and zcET (standardized
  anomaly of cumulative NDVI and ET through the growing season); and
  CHELSA v2.1 dataset to derive the standardized precipitation
  evapotranspiration index (SPEI). We evaluate the interconnection
  between the productivity drought index (zcNDVI) and water demand
  (zcET), supply (SPEIs) and FVC. Finally, we analyzed the temporal
  correlation of the drought indices with total water storage (TWS) from

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The sixth assessment report (AR6) from the working group I of the IPCC
\citep{IPCC2021} indicates that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions
have increased the frequency and/or intensity of some weather and
climate extremes and the evidence has been strengthened since AR5
\citep{IPCC2013}. There is high confidence that the increasing global
warning can expand the land area affected by increasing drought
frequency and severity \citep{IPCCCH112021}. Chile has been facing a
persistent rainfall deficit lasting for more than ten years
\citep{Garreaud2017} which has impacted the hydrological system
\citep{Boisier2018}, and consequently the vegetation development
\citep{Zambrano2020}.

Precipitation is the primary driver of drought that impacts hydrological
regimes and vegetation productivity. Thus, it is commonly classified as
meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural \citep{Wilhite1985}.
Lately, it has been argued that this definition does not fully address
the ecological dimensions \citep{Crausbay2017}. \citet{Crausbay2017}
proposed the ecological drought definition as ``an episodic deficit in
water availability that drives ecosystems beyond thresholds of
vulnerability, impacts ecosystem services, and triggers feedback in
natural and/or human systems''. The AR6 \citep{IPCC2021} state that even
if global warming is stabilized at 1.5°-2°C many parts of the world will
be impacted by more severe agricultural and ecological drought. Central
Chile has suffered from crop productivity failure, highlighting the
growing season 2007-2008 and 2008-2009
\citep{Zambrano2016, Zambrano2018}, which impacted an extensive surface.
But, in 2019-2020, the drought intensity reached an extreme condition at
North 34°S not seen -at least- for more than 40 years
\citep{Zambrano2020}, affecting forest, grassland, and croplands areas.
The prolonged lack of precipitation within Central Chile is producing
changes in the ecosystem that should study.

Satellite remote sensing \citep{West2019, AghaKouchak2015} is the
primary method to evaluate how meteorological drought impacts vegetation
dynamics. Since the 90's multiple vegetation drought indices have been
derived (VCI,\citep{Kogan1990}; TCI, \citep{Kogan1995};zNDVI,
\citep{Peters2002}; VegDri, \citep{Brown2008}) that have allowed making
spatiotemporal analysis. Although we can calculate those indices for any
time during the year (depending on satellite revisit), there are
relevant during the stage vegetation has more activity, the growing
season \citep{Mishra2015}. Although modeling phenology is a complex
task, satellites offer strategies that help to address it
\citep{Younes2021, Vrieling2018, Cai2017}. Also, the land cover dynamics
product MCD12Q2 from the USGS \citep{Friedl2019} provides some phenology
metrics. Some authors have proposed indices aggregated during the
season. \citet{Meroni2017} accumulating the fractional active
photosynthetic active radiation(FAPAR) between the start (SOS) and the
end of the season (EOS) in the Sahel, calculate the zCFAPAR.
\citet{Zambrano2018} used the same approach but with the NDVI
(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), derivating the zcNDVI within
Central Chile. Besides, land use land cover (LULC) change can be driven
by drought \citep{Tran2019, Akinyemi2021}. To analyze those changes,
multiple time-series LULC products exist as the MCD12Q1
\citep{Friedl2019} and the ESA CCI-LC \citep{ESA2017}. For Chile, 2014
was made a high-resolution land cover at 30m of spatial resolution
\citep{Zhao2016}. The LULC product with the vegetation drought index can
help evaluate the impact of drought on the ecosystem.

Vegetation drought indices are commonly used as proxies of productivity
\citep{Paruelo2016, Schucknecht2017}. The main environmental variables
that affect productivity are water supply and demand \citep{Mishra2015}.
Those are measured by precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET),
commonly collected from weather stations. Usually, in developing
countries (i.e., Chile), incomplete records or gaps present a challenge.
But, there are satellite estimates of these variables. To evaluate
drought, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO; \citep{WMO2012})
has proposed the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI;
\citep{McKee1993}), a multiscalar drought index, which has been used
worldwide. For Chile, \citet{Zambrano2017} derived and evaluated it from
the product of the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with
Station data (CHIRPS; \citep{Funk2015}). For water demand, it is used
ET. The vegetation biomass productivity is strongly related to ET
\citep{FAO66}. The atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) represents the
maximum ET rate from a land surface (without water restriction), also
known as reference ET. The recommended method for its calculation is the
FAO Penman-Monteith \citep{Pereira2015, Allen2005}. Due to climate
change, AED is increasing, driving ET rise \citep{IPCCCH112021}. But, it
is not always true \citep{Milly2016}. For example, regions where AET is
highest have the lowest ET. The MOD16 product
\citep{Running2021, Mu2011} provides AET and ET satellite estimates and
has been used to derive drought indices \citep{Mu2013}. Soil moisture
(SM) is an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) that modulates vegetative
growth. The climate change initiative (CCI) from the European Space
Agency (ESA) delivers the ESA CCI SM product \citep{Dorigo2017} (current
version 6.1), which has been helpful to monitor drought
\citep{Zhang2019}. Besides, total water storage can be retrieved by the
Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), which allows analyzing
water availability changes \citep{Ahmed2014, Ma2017}. The water demand
and supply by remote sensing can help evaluate how they have impacted
vegetation productivity.

We aims to analyze the climate-induced water scarcity over continental
Chile for 2000-2023 by using estimated environmental variables of
biomass productivity, and water demand/supply gather from earth
observation products. The specific objective for the study are i) to
evaluate LULC change for 2001-2021, ii) to derive and assess the
vegetation drought index zcNDVI as a proxy of biomass productivity, iii)
analyze the interconnection of zcNDVI with drought indices of supply
(i.e., precipitation), demand (i.e, ET), and vegetation cover; and iv)
we will investigate if the observed changes are linked to the TWS and
SM.
