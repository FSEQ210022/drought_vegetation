	abstract = {While existing remote sensing-based drought indices have characterized drought conditions in arid regions successfully, their use in humid regions is limited. We propose a new remote sensing-based drought index, the Scaled Drought Condition Index (SDCI), for agricultural drought monitoring in both arid and humid regions using multi-sensor data. This index combines the land surface temperature (LST) data and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, and precipitation data from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. Each variable was scaled from 0 to 1 to discriminate the effect of drought from normal conditions, and then combined with the selected weights. When tested against in-situ Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Palmer's Z-Index (Z-Index), 3-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), and 6-month SPI data during a ten-year (2000-2009) period, SDCI performed better than existing indices such as NDVI and Vegetation Health Index (VHI) in the arid region of Arizona and New Mexico as well as in the humid region of North Carolina and South Carolina. The year-to-year changes and spatial distributions of SDCI over both arid and humid regions generally agreed to the changes documented by the United States Drought Monitor (USDM) maps. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The relationship between the satellite-based Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and a number of frequently used meteorological drought indices was evaluated using data from all 254 Texas counties during 18 growing-seasons (March to August, 1982-1999). In particular, the response of the VCI was compared to that of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Moisture Anomaly Index (Z-index), Standard Precipitation Index (SPI), percent normal, and deciles. Overall the VCI is most strongly correlated with the 6-month SPI, 9-month SPI and PDSI. This indicates that, at least over Texas, the growing-season VCI responds to prolonged moisture stress and it appears to be less sensitive to short-term precipitation deficiencies. There was also significant spatial variability in the strength of the relationship between the VCI and the meteorological drought indices. Generally, counties in northwestern and southwestern Texas had much higher correlations (R2 {\textgreater} 0.6) than counties in eastern Texas and along the Gulf Coast (R2 {\textless} 0.1). Nearly 75\% of these spatial variations can be explained using a series of environmental variables. It appears that the climate region is the most important determinant of the nature of the relationship between the VCI and PDSI. Other important variables include the land use/land cover in each county, the amount of irrigation, and soil properties. These results demonstrate that care must be taken when using the VCI for monitoring drought because it is not highly correlated with station-based meteorological drought indices and it is strongly influenced by spatially varying environmental factors. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Findings include the following: (1) large sectors of Africa are undergoing statistically significant TWS variations (+. 44. mm/yr to -15. mm/yr) due to natural and anthropogenic causes; (2) warming of the tropical Atlantic Ocean apparently intensified Atlantic monsoons and increased precipitation and TWS over western and central Africa; (3) warming in the central Indian Ocean decreased precipitation and TWS over eastern Africa; (4) the high frequency of flooding events increased TWS over the Zambezi and Okavango basins; (5) extraction of fossil groundwater decreased TWS over the Saharan aquifers; (6) deforestation decreased TWS in three subbasins (Ubangi, Congo, and Sangha) of the Congo River Basin; and (7) the construction of dams increased TWS in the Blue Nile and Atbara subbasins. Given the 10. years of monthly GRACE data acquired on the subbasin scale across the globe, as well as the plans underway for deployment of a GRACE-FO and GRACE-II, using GRACE-derived TWS data should be considered an alternative, viable index for measuring temporal and spatial variations in water availability. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Droughts are one of the most devastating natural disasters, which impose increasing risks to humanity and the environment in the 21st century. The recent and continuous drought in China has led to detrimental effects on the local environment and societies in Yunnan Province, thus there is an urgent need to monitor the spatial and temporal evolution of the drought. The characteristics of the spatial distribution of drought processes and the impact of droughts on soil moisture and water storage remains unclear. In this study, the direction, magnitude, start time, and duration of droughts were investigated, based on Total Water Storage Anomalies (TWSA) of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), Climate Change Initiative Soil Moisture (CCI SM), and observed precipitation data. The spatial patterns of TWSA trends at each time duration segment suggest that the evolution of drought processes is very complex, and can be clustered into three zones. The spatial distribution of TWSA revealed that the drought status lasted more than one year longer in the north and east parts compared to other parts of Yunnan Province. Water losses occurred in the south part, while water gains were found in the central, north, and east parts of Yunnan Province, from 2002 to 2014, indicating a higher possibility of droughts in the south part in the future. Both de-seasonalized TWSA and CCI SM effectively captured the serious drought from 2009 to 2010 in Yunnan, and their spatial patterns were found to be consistent. The drought detected from CCI SMA had a one-month lag and TWSA had a two-month lag, in comparison to the meteorological drought from precipitation data, which indicates that the drought data derived from CCI SMA and TWSA are better able to represent the impact of droughts, particularly on agriculture. The contribution of surface SM changes in TWSA was determined to be about 41.94\%, suggesting that variations in soil moisture only explain less than half of the total water storage change. GRACE observations and CCI SM can be used as important indicators of the spatial distribution of the drought process and its impact on the environment and local communities, which will improve the management of water resources and early detection and monitoring of droughts.},

In this article, a cumulative distribution function is applied to match the simulated SM from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and fill in the missing records of ESA CCI SM. The weekly standard SM index (SSI) calculated from the ESA CCI SM dataset is utilized to monitor the agricultural drought over the Yellow River Basin (YRB) during 2000-2012. The performance of the ESA CCI SSI is compared with the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index based on VIC model (VIC-scPDSI) and the anomalies of ESA CCI SM and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The results show that the interpolated ESA CCI SM is significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) correlated with the observed SM, and more than 84\% of the grids in the YRB display strong correlations with the global reanalysis SM. ESA CCI SSI presents a similar spatiotemporal pattern as VIC-scPDSI, while exhibiting a significantly delayed response to SPI and SPEI. The average residence time of drought reflected by ESA CCI SSI from short periods of extreme drought and long periods of less extreme drought are above 1 week and 3 weeks later than that represented by SPI and SPEI. Severe and extreme drought areas detected by ESA CCI SSI are generally larger than that captured by SPI, SPEI, and VIC-scPDSI.},

	abstract = {Climate Data Records of soil moisture are fundamental for improving our understanding of long-term dynamics in the coupled water, energy, and carbon cycles over land. To respond to this need, in 2012 the European Space Agency (ESA) released the first multi-decadal, global satellite-observed soil moisture (SM) dataset as part of its Climate Change Initiative (CCI) program. This product, named ESA CCI SM, combines various single-sensor active and passive microwave soil moisture products into three harmonised products: a merged ACTIVE, a merged PASSIVE, and a COMBINED active + passive microwave product. Compared to the first product release, the latest version of ESA CCI SM includes a large number of enhancements, incorporates various new satellite sensors, and extends its temporal coverage to the period 1978–2015. In this study, we first provide a comprehensive overview of the characteristics, evolution, and performance of the ESA CCI SM products. Based on original research and a review of existing literature we show that the product quality has steadily increased with each successive release and that the merged products generally outperform the single-sensor input products. Although ESA CCI SM generally agrees well with the spatial and temporal patterns estimated by land surface models and observed in-situ, we identify surface conditions (e.g., dense vegetation, organic soils) for which it still has large uncertainties. Second, capitalising on the results of {\textgreater} 100 research studies that made use of the ESA CCI SM data we provide a synopsis of how it has contributed to improved process understanding in the following Earth system domains: climate variability and change, land-atmosphere interactions, global biogeochemical cycles and ecology, hydrological and land surface modelling, drought applications, and meteorology. While in some disciplines the use of ESA CCI SM is already widespread (e.g. in the evaluation of model soil moisture states) in others (e.g. in numerical weather prediction or flood forecasting) it is still in its infancy. The latter is partly related to current shortcomings of the product, e.g., the lack of near-real-time availability and data gaps in time and space. This study discloses the discrepancies between current ESA CCI SM product characteristics and the preferred characteristics of long-term satellite soil moisture products as outlined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), and provides important directions for future ESA CCI SM product improvements to bridge these gaps.},

In this study, we have further improved the ET algorithm in Mu et al. (2007a, hereafter called old algorithm) by 1) simplifying the calculation of vegetation cover fraction; 2) calculating ET as the sum of daytime and nighttime components; 3) adding soil heat flux calculation; 4) improving estimates of stomatal conductance, aerodynamic resistance and boundary layer resistance; 5) separating dry canopy surface from the wet; and 6) dividing soil surface into saturated wet surface and moist surface. We compared the improved algorithm with the old one both globally and locally at 46 eddy flux towers. The global annual total ET over the vegetated land surface is 62.8×103km3, agrees very well with other reported estimates of 65.5×103km3 over the terrestrial land surface, which is much higher than 45.8×103km3 estimated with the old algorithm. For ET evaluation at eddy flux towers, the improved algorithm reduces mean absolute bias (MAE) of daily ET from 0.39mm day-1 to 0.33mmday-1 driven by tower meteorological data, and from 0.40mmday-1 to 0.31mmday-1 driven by GMAO data, a global meteorological reanalysis dataset. MAE values by the improved ET algorithm are 24.6\% and 24.1\% of the ET measured from towers, within the range (10-30\%) of the reported uncertainties in ET measurements, implying an enhanced accuracy of the improved algorithm. Compared to the old algorithm, the improved algorithm increases the skill score with tower-driven ET estimates from 0.50 to 0.55, and from 0.46 to 0.53 with GMAO-driven ET. Based on these results, the improved ET algorithm has a better performance in generating global ET data products, providing critical information on global terrestrial water and energy cycles and environmental changes. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No 56 on Crop Evapotranspiration has been in publication for more than 15 years. The paper advanced the accuracy and consistency of operational computation of evapotranspiration (ET) for agricultural and other land use types. The paper included updated definition and procedures for computing reference ET, an update on estimating crop coefficients (Kc), the adoption of the dual Kc for separate estimation of crop transpiration and soil evaporation, and an upgraded estimation of crop ET under water and salt stress and other non-standard conditions. These advances are retrospectively reviewed in this paper. The advances in computing reference ET were primarily through the adoption of specific and consistent characteristics for the grass reference crop using the Penman-Monteith equation parameterized to represent a living reference surface. That standardization made the Kc more visual and understandable as a factor that relates the ET characteristics of a specific crop to the defined reference crop. Methodologies were introduced to estimate reference ET under conditions of limited weather data while retaining the use of the PM equation. Advances in adopted Kc research included techniques to estimate Kc based on the architecture of crops, notably height and fraction of ground cover. Other advances included consistent and straight-forward techniques for applying the dual Kc method via soil and evaporation process modeling on a daily timestep. New techniques were introduced for using yield response and salinity threshold values to estimate reductions in ET caused by elevated soil salinity. In addition, recommendations were given for adjusting ET for impacts of surface mulching, intercropping, and sparse vegetation. The successful adoption of the FAO-PM reference ET and Kc approaches owes primarily to the simplicity, yet relatively high level of robustness of the procedures, and to transferability and repeatability of the Kc method. Future development needs are discussed.},

	abstract = {By various measures (drought area and intensity, climatic aridity index, and climatic water deficits), some observational analyses have suggested that much of the Earth's land has been drying during recent decades, but such drying seems inconsistent with observations of dryland greening and decreasing pan evaporation. 'Offline' analyses of climate-model outputs from anthropogenic climate change (ACC) experiments portend continuation of putative drying through the twenty-first century, despite an expected increase in global land precipitation. A ubiquitous increase in estimates of potential evapotranspiration (PET), driven by atmospheric warming, underlies the drying trends, but may be a methodological artefact. Here we show that the PET estimator commonly used (the Penman-Monteith PET for either an open-water surface or a reference crop) severely overpredicts the changes in non-water-stressed evapotranspiration computed in the climate models themselves in ACC experiments. This overprediction is partially due to neglect of stomatal conductance reductions commonly induced by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations in climate models. Our findings imply that historical and future tendencies towards continental drying, as characterized by offline-computed runoff, as well as other PET-dependent metrics, may be considerably weaker and less extensive than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Drought is an insidious natural hazard that results from lower levels of precipitations than what is considered normal. When this phenomenon extends over a season or a longer period of time, precipitation is insufficient to meet the demands of human activities and the environment. Drought must be considered a relative, rather than absolute, condition. There are also many different methodologies for monitoring drought. Droughts are regional in extent and each region has specific climatic characteristics. Droughts that occur in the North American Great Plains will differ from those that occur in northeast Brazil, southern Africa, western Europe, eastern Australia, or the North China Plain. The amount, seasonality and form of precipitation differ widely between each of these locations. Temperature, wind and relative humidity are also important factors to include in characterizing drought. Drought monitoring also needs to be application-specific because drought impacts will vary between sectors. Drought means different things to different users such as water managers, agricultural producers, hydroelectric power plant operators and wildlife biologists. Even within sectors, there are many different perspectives of drought because impacts may differ markedly. Droughts are commonly classified by type as meteorological, agricultural and hydrological, and differ from one another in intensity, duration and spatial coverage.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing studies of vegetation phenology increasingly benefit from freely available satellite imagery acquired with high temporal frequency at fine spatial resolution. Particularly for heterogeneous landscapes this is good news, given the drawback of medium-resolution sensors commonly used for phenology retrieval (e.g., MODIS) to properly represent the fine-scale spatial variability of vegetation types. The Sentinel-2 mission acquires spectral data globally at 10 to 60 m resolution every five days. To illustrate the mission's potential for studying vegetation phenology, we retrieved phenological parameters for the Dutch barrier island Schiermonnikoog for a full season of Sentinel-2A observations in 2016. Overlapping orbits resulted in two acquisitions per 10 days, similar to what is achieved globally since the launch of Sentinel-2B. For eight locations on the island's salt marsh we compared greenness chromatic coordinate (GCC) series derived from digital repeat RGB-cameras with vegetation index series derived from Sentinel-2 (NDVI and GCC). For each series, a double hyperbolic tangent model was fitted and thresholds were applied to the modelled data to estimate start-, peak-, and end-of-season (SOS/PS/EOS). Variability in Sentinel-2 derived SOS, when taken as the midpoint between minimum and peak NDVI, was well-explained by camera GCC-based SOS (R2 = 0.74, MSD = 8.0 days, RMSD = 13.0 days). However, EOS estimates from camera GCC series were on average almost two months before NDVI-based estimates. This could partially be explained by the observed exponential relationship between GCC and NDVI, as well as by the combined effect of viewing angle differences and the presence of non-photosynthetic elements in the vegetation canopy. A two-layer canopy radiative transfer model incorporating reduced chlorophyll levels in the upper layer provided a physically-based explanation of the viewing angle effect. Finally, we applied the phenology retrieval approach to NDVI series for all pixels of the island in order to map spatial patterns of phenology at fine resolution. Our results demonstrate the potential of the Sentinel-2 mission for providing spatially-detailed retrievals of phenology.},

	abstract = {Satellite-derived phenology (or apparent phenology) is frequently used to illustrate changes in plant phenology (i.e. true phenology) and the effects of climate forcing. However, each study uses a different method to detect phenology. Plant phenology refers to the relationship between the life cycle of plants and weather and climate events. Phenology is often studied in the field, but recently studies have transitioned towards using satellite images to monitor phenology at the plot, country, and continental scales. The problem with this approach is that there is an ever-increasing variety of earth observation satellites collecting data with different spatial, spectral, and temporal characteristics. In this paper we ask if studies that detect phenology using different sensors over the same site produce comparable results. Mangrove forests are one example where different methods have been used to examine their apparent phenology. In general, plant phenology, including mangroves, is described using few individual plants, but continental-scale descriptions of phenological events are scarce or inexistent. Few attempts have been made to describe the phenology of mangroves using satellite imagery, and each study presents a different method. We hypothesize that apparent phenology changes with: 1) areal extent; 2) site location; 3) frequency of observation; 4) spatial resolution; 5) temporal coverage; and 6) the number of cloud contaminated observations. Intuitively, one would assume that these hypotheses hold true, yet few studies have investigated this. For example, one would expect that clouds change the observed phenology of vegetation, that the number of species captured at spatial resolution will impact the apparent phenology, or that mangroves in different places display different phenologies, but how are these changes represented in the apparent phenology? We use the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) to examine the changes in the start of season and peak growing season dates, as well as the shape and amplitude of the apparent phenology in each hypothesis. We use Landsat and Sentinel 2 imagery over the mangrove forests in Darwin Harbour (Northern Territory, Australia) as a case study, and found that apparent phenology does change with the sensor, site, and cloud contamination. Importantly, the apparent phenology is comparable between Landsat and Sentinel 2 sensors, but it is not comparable to phenology derived from MODIS. This is due to differences in the spatial resolution of the sensors. Cloud contamination also significantly changes the apparent phenology of vegetation. In this paper we expose the complexity of modelling phenology with remote sensing and help guide future phenology investigations.},

	abstract = {Drought severity and impact assessments are necessary to effectively monitor droughts in semi-arid contexts. However, little is known about the influence land use-land cover (LULC) has—in terms of the differences in annual sizes and configurations—on drought effects. Coupling remote sensing and Geographic Information System techniques, drought evolution was assessed and mapped. During the growing season, drought severity and the effects on LULC were examined and whether these differed between areas of land change and persistence. This study used areas of economic importance to Botswana as case studies. Vegetation Condition Index, derived from Normalised Difference Vegetation Index time series for the growing seasons (2000–2018 in comparison to 2020–2021), was used to assess droughts for 17 constituencies (Botswana’s fourth administrative level) in the Central District of Botswana. Further analyses by LULC types and land change highlighted the vulnerability of both human and natural systems to drought. Identified drought periods in the time series correspond to declared drought years by the Botswana government. Drought severity (extreme, severe, moderate and mild) and the percentage of land areas affected varied in both space and time. The growing seasons of 2002–2003, 2003–2004 and 2015–2016 were the most drought-stricken in the entire time series, coinciding with the El Niño southern oscillation (ENSO). The lower-than-normal vegetation productivity during these growing seasons was evident from the analysis. With the above-normal vegetation productivity in the ongoing season (2020–2021), the results suggest the reversal of the negative vegetation trends observed in the preceding growing seasons. However, the extent of this reversal cannot be confidently ascertained with the season still ongoing. Relating drought severity and intensities to LULC and change in selected drought years revealed that most lands affected by extreme and severe drought (in descending order) were in tree-covered areas (forests and woodlands), grassland/rangelands and croplands. These LULC types were the most affected as extreme drought intersected vegetation productivity decline. The most impacted constituencies according to drought severity and the number of drought events were Mahalapye west (eight), Mahalapye east (seven) and Boteti west (seven). Other constituencies experienced between six and two drought events of varying durations throughout the time series. Since not all constituencies were affected similarly during declared droughts, studies such as this contribute to devising appropriate context-specific responses aimed at minimising drought impacts on social-ecological systems. The methodology utilised can apply to other drylands where climatic and socioeconomic contexts are similar to those of Botswana.},

The study area is in the sub-humid region of the northern coastal zone of Binh Thuan province, Vietnam\&mdash;Tuy Phong district. This area is indicated as a subject of prolonged droughts during 6-month dry seasons, which have occurred more frequently in recent years.

A bi-temporal analysis using high-resolution data, the 2011 WorldView2 and the 2016 GeoEye1, was examined to assess LULC changes from observed severe droughts in those three communes. Results showed a dramatic reduction in the extent of hydrological systems (about 20\%), and significant increases of tree canopies in urban areas and near the coastal areas (approximately 76.8\%). Paddy fields declined by 51\% in 2016; such areas transitioned to inactive status or were alternated for growing drought-tolerant plants. Shrimp farming experienced a recognizable decrease by approximately 44\%. The 2014 map and field observations during summer 2016 provide references for object-based classification and validation.

Gridded rainfall estimates are used to compute the SPI for 1–6-month timescales, whereas the Z-score of the cumulative value of the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation over the growing season (zCFAPAR) is used as a proxy of seasonal productivity. Results show that the strength of the link varies in space as a function of both the SPI timescale and the timing of the SPI calculation with respect to the vegetative season’s progress. For productivity forecasting, we propose an operational strategy to select per grid cell the SPI timescale and computation time with the highest correlation with zCFAPAR at different moments of the season. The linear relationship between SPI and zCFAPAR is significant for 32–66\% of the study area, depending on the timing at which SPI is considered (at 0\% and 75\% of the seasonal progress, respectively). For these areas, the selected SPI explains on average about 40\% of the variance of zCFAPAR and may thus assist in the earlier identification of agricultural drought.},

	abstract = {Drought is of global concern for society but it originates as a local problem. It has a significant impact on water quantity and quality and influences food, water, and energy security. The consequences of drought vary in space and time, from the local scale (e.g. county level) to regional scale (e.g. state or country level) to global scale. Within the regional scale, there are multiple socio-economic impacts (i.e., agriculture, drinking water supply, and stream health) occurring individually or in combination at local scales, either in clusters or scattered. Even though the application of aggregated drought information at the regional level has been useful in drought management, the latter can be further improved by evaluating the structure and evolution of a drought at the local scale. This study addresses a local-scale agricultural drought anatomy in Story County in Iowa, USA. This complex problem was evaluated using assimilated AMSR-E soil moisture and MODIS-LAI data into a crop model to generate surface and sub-surface drought indices to explore the anatomy of an agricultural drought. Quantification of moisture supply in the root zone remains a gray area in research community, this challenge can be partly overcome by incorporating assimilation of soil moisture and leaf area index into crop modeling framework for agricultural drought quantification, as it performs better in simulating crop yield. It was noted that the persistence of subsurface droughts is in general higher than surface droughts, which can potentially improve forecast accuracy. It was found that both surface and subsurface droughts have an impact on crop yields, albeit with different magnitudes, however, the total water available in the soil profile seemed to have a greater impact on the yield. Further, agricultural drought should not be treated equal for all crops, and it should be calculated based on the root zone depth rather than a fixed soil layer depth. We envisaged that the results of this study will enhance our understanding of agricultural droughts in different parts of the world.},

	abstract = {Drought is onee of the major natural hazards affecting the environment and economy of countries worldwide. Reliance on weather data alone is not sufficient to monitor areas of drought, particularly when these data can be untimely, sparse, and incomplete. Augmenting weather data with satellite images to identify the location and severity of droughts is a must for complete, up-to-date, and comprehensive coverage of current drought conditions. The objective of this research was to standardize, by time of year, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to augment drought-monitoring techniques. The Standardized Vegetation Index (SVI) describes the probability of vegetation condition deviation from "normal," based on calculations from weekly NDVI values. The study was conducted with 12 years (1989-2000) of Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite images. Z-scores of the NDVI distribution are used to estimate the probability of occurrence of the present vegetation condition at a given location relative to the possible range of vegetative vigor, historically. The SVI can be interpreted as vegetation condition based on the fact that vegetation is an efficient integrator of climatic and anthropogenic impacts in the boundary layer of the atmosphere. It thereby provides a spatially and temporally continuous short-term indicator of climatic conditions. Findings indicate that the SVI, along with other drought monitoring tools, is useful for assessing the extent and severity of drought at a spatial resolution of 1 km. The SVI is capable of providing a near-real-time indicator of vegetation condition within drought regions, and more specifically areas of varying drought conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Successful application of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for estimating weather impacts on vegetation is currently hindered in non-homogeneous areas. The problem is that the differences between the level of vegetation in these areas can be related, in addition to weather impacts, to the differences in geographic resources (climate, soil, vegetation type and topography). These differences should be eliminated when weather impacts on vegetation are estimated from NDVI data. This paper discusses a concept and a technique for eliminating that portion of the NDVI which is related to the contribution of geographic resources to the amount of vegetation. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data of the Global Vegetation Index format were used for the 1984-1987 seasons in Sudan. The procedure suggests normalization of NDVI values relative to the absolute maximum and the absolute minimum of NDVI. These two criteria were shown to be an appropriate characteristic of geographic resources of an area. The modified NDVI was named the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). Comparison between VCI, NDVI and precipitation dynamics showed that the VCI estimates better portray precipitation dynamics as compared to the NDVI. The VCI permits not only the desciption of vegetation but also estimation of spatial and temporal vegetation changes and weather impacts on vegetation.},

Effective drought monitoring is therefore critical, both to the research community in developing an understanding of drought, and to those responsible for drought management and mitigation. Over the past 50 years remote sensing has shifted the field away from reliance on traditional site-based measurements and enabled observations and estimates of key drought-related variables over larger spatial and temporal scales than was previously possible. This has proven especially important in data poor regions with limited in-situ monitoring stations. Available remotely sensed data products now represent almost all aspects of drought propagation and have contributed to our understanding of the phenomena. In this review we chart the rise of remote sensing for drought monitoring, examining key milestones and technologies for assessing meteorological, agricultural and hydrological drought events. We reflect on challenges the research community has faced to date, such as limitations associated with data record length and spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. This review then looks ahead to the future in terms of new technologies, such as the ESA Sentinel satellites, analytical platforms and approaches, such as Google EarthEngine, and the utility of existing data in new drought monitoring applications.

	abstract = {This review surveys current and emerging drought monitoring approaches using satellite remote sensing observations from climatological and ecosystem perspectives. We argue that satellite observations not currently used for operational drought monitoring, such as near-surface air relative humidity data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder mission, provide opportunities to improve early drought warning. Current and future satellite missions offer opportunities to develop composite and multi-indicator drought models. While there are immense opportunities, there are major challenges including data continuity, unquantified uncertainty, sensor changes, and community acceptability. One of the major limitations of many of the currently available satellite observations is their short length of record. A number of relevant satellite missions and sensors (e.g., the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) provide only a decade of data, which may not be sufficient to study droughts from a climate perspective. However, they still provide valuable information about relevant hydrologic and ecological processes linked to this natural hazard. Therefore, there is a need for models and algorithms that combine multiple data sets and/or assimilate satellite observations into model simulations to generate long-term climate data records. Finally, the study identifies a major gap in indicators for describing drought impacts on the carbon and nitrogen cycle, which are fundamental to assessing drought impacts on ecosystems.

Although intense 1- or 2-year droughts are recurrent in this Mediterranean-like region, the ongoing event stands out because of its longevity and large spatial extent. The extraordinary character of the so-called Central Chile Mega Drought (MD) was established against century long historical records and a millennial tree-ring reconstruction of regional precipitation. The largest MD-averaged rainfall relative anomalies occurred in the northern, semi-arid sector of central Chile but the event was unprecedented to the south of 35\&amp;deg;\&amp;thinsp;S. ENSO neutral conditions have prevailed since 2011 (but for the strong El Niño 2015) contrasting with La Niña conditions that often accompanied past droughts. The precipitation deficit diminished the Andean snowpack and resulted in amplified declines (up to 90\&amp;thinsp;\%) of river flow, reservoir volumes and groundwater levels along central Chile and westernmost Argentina. In some semiarid basins we also found a conspicuous decrease in the runoff-to-rainfall coefficient. A substantial decrease in vegetation productivity occurred in the shrubland-dominated, northern sector, but a mix of greening and browning patches occurred farther south where irrigated croplands and exotic forest plantations dominate. The ongoing warming in central Chile, making the MD one of the warmest 6-year period on record, may have also contributed to such complex vegetation changes by increasing potential evapotranspiration. The understanding of the nature and biophysical impacts of the MD contributes to preparedness efforts to face a dry, warm future regional climate scenario.},

	abstract = {Precipitation is a key parameter for the study of climate change and variability and the detection and monitoring of natural disaster such as drought. Precipitation datasets that accurately capture the amount and spatial variability of rainfall is critical for drought monitoring and a wide range of other climate applications. This is challenging in many parts of the world, which often have a limited number of weather stations and/or historical data records. Satellite-derived precipitation products offer a viable alternative with several remotely sensed precipitation datasets now available with long historical data records (+30years), which include the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) datasets. This study presents a comparative analysis of three historical satellite-based precipitation datasets that include Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B43 version 7 (1998–2015), PERSIANN-CDR (1983–2015) and CHIRPS 2.0 (1981–2015) over Chile to assess their performance across the country and for the case of the two long-term products the applicability for agricultural drought were evaluated when used in the calculation of commonly used drought indicator as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). In this analysis, 278 weather stations of in situ rainfall measurements across Chile were initially compared to the satellite data. The study area (Chile) was divided into five latitudinal zones: North, North-Central, Central, South-Central and South to determine if there were a regional difference among these satellite products, and nine statistics were used to evaluate their performance to estimate the amount and spatial distribution of historical rainfall across Chile. Hierarchical cluster analysis, k-means and singular value decomposition were used to analyze these datasets to better understand their similarities and differences in characterizing rainfall patterns across Chile. Monthly analysis showed that all satellite products highly overestimated rainfall in the arid North zone. However, there were no major difference between all three products from North to South-Central zones. Though, in the South zone, PERSIANN-CDR shows the lowest fit with high underestimation, while CHIRPS 2.0 and TMPA 3B43 v7 had better agreement with in situ measurements. The accuracy of satellite products were highly dependent on the amount of monthly rainfall with the best results found during winter seasons and in zones (Central to South) with higher amounts of precipitation. PERSIANN-CDR and CHIRPS 2.0 were used to derive SPI at time-scale of 1, 3 and 6 months, both satellite products presented similar results when it was compared in situ against satellite SPI's. Because of its higher spatial resolution that allows better characterizing of spatial variation in precipitation pattern, the CHIRPS 2.0 was used to mapping the SPI-3 over Chile. The results of this study show that in order to use the CHIRPS 2.0 and PERSIANN-CDR datasets in Chile to monitor spatial patterns in the rainfall and drought intensity conditions, these products should be calibrated to adjust for the overestimation/underestimation of rainfall geographically specially in the North zone and seasonally during the summer and spring months in the other zones.},

	abstract = {The authors propose a new climatic drought index: the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The SPEI is based on precipitation and temperature data, and it has the advantage of combining multiscalar character with the capacity to include the effects of temperature variability on drought assessment. The procedure to calculate the index is detailed and involves a climatic water balance, the accumulation of deficit/surplus at different time scales, and adjustment to a log-logistic probability distribution. Mathematically, the SPEI is similar to the standardized precipitation index (SPI), but it includes the role of temperature. Because the SPEI is based on a water balance, it can be compared to the self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (sc-PDSI). Time series of the three indices were compared for a set of observatories with different climate characteristics, located in different parts of the world. Under global warming conditions, only the sc-PDSI and SPEI identified an increase in drought severity associated with higher water demand as a result of evapotranspiration. Relative to the sc-PDSI, the SPEI has the advantage of being multiscalar, which is crucial for drought analysis and monitoring. © 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {Global food security is negatively affected by drought. Climate projections show that drought frequency and intensity may increase in different parts of the globe. These increases are particularly hazardous for developing countries. Early season forecasts on drought occurrence and severity could help to better mitigate the negative consequences of drought. The objective of this study was to assess if interannual variability in agricultural productivity in Chile can be accurately predicted from freely-available, near real-time data sources. As the response variable, we used the standard score of seasonal cumulative NDVI (zcNDVI), based on 2000–2017 data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), as a proxy for anomalies of seasonal primary productivity. The predictions were performed with forecast lead times from one- to six-month before the end of the growing season, which varied between census units in Chile. Predictor variables included the zcNDVI obtained by cumulating NDVI from season start up to prediction time; standardised precipitation indices derived from satellite rainfall estimates, for time-scales of 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months; the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Multivariate ENSO oscillation indices; the length of the growing season, and latitude and longitude. For each of the 758 census units considered, the time series of the response and the predictor variables were averaged for agricultural areas resulting in a 17-season time series per unit for each variable. We used two prediction approaches: (i) optimal linear regression (OLR) whereby for each census unit the single predictor was selected that best explained the interannual zcNDVI variability, and (ii) a multi-layer feedforward neural network architecture, often called deep learning (DL), where all predictors for all units were combined in a single spatio-temporal model. Both approaches were evaluated with a leave-one-year-out cross-validation procedure. Both methods showed good prediction accuracies for small lead times and similar values for all lead times. The mean Rcv2 values for OLR were 0.95, 0.83, 0.68, 0.56, 0.46 and 0.37, against 0.96, 0.84, 0.65, 0.54, 0.46 and 0.38 for DL, for one, two, three, four, five, and six months lead time, respectively. Given the wide range of climates and vegetation types covered within the study area, we expect that the presented models can contribute to an improved early warning system for agricultural drought in different geographical settings around the globe.},

There are several advantages to using remote sensing to monitor drought, especially in developing countries with limited historical meteorological records and a low weather station density. In the present study, we assessed agricultural drought in the croplands of the BioBío Region in Chile. The vegetation condition index (VCI) allows identifying the temporal and spatial variations of vegetation conditions associated with stress because of rainfall deficit. The VCI was derived at a 250 m spatial resolution for the 2000-2015 period with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD13Q1 product. We evaluated VCI for cropland areas using the land cover MCD12Q1 version 5.1 product and compared it to the in situ Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for six-time scales (1-6 months) from 26 weather stations. Results showed that the 3-month SPI (SPI-3), calculated for the modified growing season (November-April) instead of the regular growing season (September-April), has the best Pearson correlation with VCI values with an overall correlation of 0.63 and between 0.40 and 0.78 for the administrative units. These results show a very short-term vegetation response to rainfall deficit in September, which is reflected in the vegetation in November, and also explains to a large degree the variation in vegetation stress. It is shown that for the last 16 years in the BioBío Region we could identify the 2007/2008, 2008/2009, and 2014/2015 seasons as the three most important drought events; this is reflected in both the overall regional and administrative unit analyses. These results concur with drought emergencies declared by the regional government. Future studies are needed to associate the remote sensing values observed at high resolution (250 m) with the measured crop yield to identify more detailed individual crop responses.},

	abstract = {The socio-ecological sensitivity to water deficits makes Chile highly vulnerable to global change. New evidence of a multi-decadal drying trend and the impacts of a persistent drought that since 2010 has affected several regions of the country, reinforce the need for clear diagnoses of the hydro-climate changes in Chile. Based on the analysis of long-term records (50+ years) of precipitation and streamflow, we confirm a tendency toward a dryer condition in central-southern Chile (30-48°S). We describe the geographical and seasonal character of this trend, as well as the associated large-scale circulation patterns. When a large ensemble of climate model simulations is contrasted to observations, anthropogenic forcing appears as the leading factor of precipitation change. In addition to a drying trend driven by greenhouse gas forcing in all seasons, our results indicate that the Antarctic stratospheric ozone depletion has played a major role in the summer rainfall decline. Although average model results agree well with the drying trend's seasonal character, the observed change magnitude is two to three times larger than that simulated, indicating a potential underestimation of future projections for this region. Under present-day carbon emission rates, the drying pathway in Chile will likely prevail during the next decades, although the summer signal should weaken as a result of the gradual ozone layer recovery. The trends and scenarios shown here pose substantial stress on Chilean society and its institutions, and call for urgent action regarding adaptation measures.},

              As impacted by climate change and further global warming, drought turns out to be the most frequent meteorological extreme event worldwide, which severely affects agriculture, ecosystem, water management and even human survival. In this study, the global pattern and development trends \& directions on drought monitoring were presented based on Web of Science database by conducting a bibliometric analysis from 1983 to 2020. The following conclusions were drawn. (1) The USA and China were found as the most productive and influential nations, accounting for 24.63\% and 14.30\% in publication outputs and taking up 5023 and 2040 in local citations, respectively. (2) Chinese Academy of Science was reported as the core institution with 5.73\% publication outputs and 829 local citations. (3)

              were found as the most influential journals and the most productive journals with 1045 local citations and 210 publication outputs, respectively. (4) Agricultural drought profoundly affecting food security was found as the most concerned drought type in the world. The drought monitoring research mainly focus on the research and development of drought index, the response of terrestrial ecosystems to drought, and the trends and dynamics of drought in context of climate change. This study explored key findings, contradictions, and limitations of drought monitoring studies were summarized and explored. In addition, the development trend and research direction of drought monitoring researches in the future were also explored.},

This opinion piece includes a review of the recent scientific literature on the topic and analyses trends in meteorological droughts by using long-term precipitation records and different drought metrics to evaluate the role of global warming processes in trends of agricultural, hydrological and ecological drought severity over the last four decades, during which a sharp increase in atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) has been recorded. Meteorological droughts do not show any substantial changes at the global scale in at least the last 120 years, but an increase in the severity of agricultural and ecological droughts seems to emerge as a consequence of the increase in the severity of AED. Lastly, this study evaluates drought projections from earth system models and focuses on the most important aspects that need to be considered when evaluating drought processes in a changing climate, such as the use of different metrics and the uncertainty of modelling approaches.

              Recent advances in processing data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) have led to a new generation of gravity solutions constrained within a Bayesian framework to remove correlated errors rather than relying on empirical filters. The JPL RL05M mascon solution is one such solution, solving for mass variations using spherical cap mass concentration elements (mascons), while relying on external information provided by near‐global geophysical models to constrain the solution. This new gravity solution is fundamentally different than the traditional spherical harmonic gravity solution, and as such, requires different care when postprocessing. Here we discuss two classes of postprocessing considerations for the JPL RL05M GRACE mascon solution: (1) reducing leakage errors across land/ocean boundaries, and (2) scaling the solutions to account for leakage errors introduced through parameterizing the gravity solution in terms of mascons. A Coastline Resolution Improvement (CRI) filter is developed to reduce leakage errors across coastlines. Synthetic simulations reveal a reduction in leakage errors of ∼50\%, such that residual leakage errors are ∼1 cm equivalent water height (EWH) averaged globally. A set of gain factors is derived to reduce leakage errors for continental hydrology applications. The combined effect of the CRI filter coupled with application of the gain factors, is shown to reduce leakage errors when determining the mass balance of large ({\textgreater}160,000 km
              2
              ) hydrological basins from 11\% to 30\% (0.6–1.5 mm EWH) averaged globally, with local improvements up to 38\%–81\% (9–19 mm EWH).

            Precipitation, soil moisture, and air temperature are the most commonly used climate variables to monitor drought; however, other climatic factors such as solar radiation, wind speed, and humidity can be important drivers in the depletion of soil moisture and evolution and persistence of drought. This work assesses the Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI) at multiple time scales for several hydroclimates as the second part of a two-part study. EDDI and individual evaporative demand components were examined as they relate to the dynamic evolution of flash drought over the central United States, characterization of hydrologic drought over the western United States, and comparison to commonly used drought metrics of the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM), Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSI), and the evaporative stress index (ESI). Two main advantages of EDDI over other drought indices are that it is independent of precipitation (similar to ESI) and it can be decomposed to identify the role individual evaporative drivers have on drought onset and persistence. At short time scales, spatial distributions and time series results illustrate that EDDI often indicates drought onset well in advance of the USDM, SPI, and SSI. Results illustrate the benefits of physically based evaporative demand estimates and demonstrate EDDI’s utility and effectiveness in an easy-to-implement agricultural early warning and long-term hydrologic drought–monitoring tool with potential applications in seasonal forecasting and fire-weather monitoring.},

            Many operational drought indices focus primarily on precipitation and temperature when depicting hydroclimatic anomalies, and this perspective can be augmented by analyses and products that reflect the evaporative dynamics of drought. The linkage between atmospheric evaporative demand E0 and actual evapotranspiration (ET) is leveraged in a new drought index based solely on E0—the Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI). EDDI measures the signal of drought through the response of E0 to surface drying anomalies that result from two distinct land surface–atmosphere interactions: 1) a complementary relationship between E0 and ET that develops under moisture limitations at the land surface, leading to ET declining and increasing E0, as in sustained droughts, and 2) parallel ET and E0 increases arising from increased energy availability that lead to surface moisture limitations, as in flash droughts. To calculate EDDI from E0, a long-term, daily reanalysis of reference ET estimated from the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) standardized reference ET equation using radiation and meteorological variables from the North American Land Data Assimilation System phase 2 (NLDAS-2) is used. EDDI is obtained by deriving empirical probabilities of aggregated E0 depths relative to their climatologic means across a user-specific time period and normalizing these probabilities. Positive EDDI values then indicate drier-than-normal conditions and the potential for drought. EDDI is a physically based, multiscalar drought index that that can serve as an indicator of both flash and sustained droughts, in some hydroclimates offering early warning relative to current operational drought indices. The performance of EDDI is assessed against other commonly used drought metrics across CONUS in Part II.},

            In this study, the authors provide a global assessment of the performance of different drought indices for monitoring drought impacts on several hydrological, agricultural, and ecological response variables. For this purpose, they compare the performance of several drought indices [the standardized precipitation index (SPI); four versions of the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI); and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI)] to predict changes in streamflow, soil moisture, forest growth, and crop yield. The authors found a superior capability of the SPEI and the SPI drought indices, which are calculated on different time scales than the Palmer indices to capture the drought impacts on the aforementioned hydrological, agricultural, and ecological variables. They detected small differences in the comparative performance of the SPI and the SPEI indices, but the SPEI was the drought index that best captured the responses of the assessed variables to drought in summer, the season in which more drought-related impacts are recorded and in which drought monitoring is critical. Hence, the SPEI shows improved capability to identify drought impacts as compared with the SPI. In conclusion, it seems reasonable to recommend the use of the SPEI if the responses of the variables of interest to drought are not known a priori.},

            The recent multiyear drought over California was characterized by large precipitation deficits and abnormally high temperatures during both wet and dry seasons. This study investigates and quantifies the contributions of precipitation and temperature anomalies to the development of the multiyear drought with a set of modeling experiments where the anomalies are either removed or randomly replaced with other historical observations. The study reveals that precipitation deficits have been largely responsible for producing the extreme agricultural drought (i.e., large soil moisture deficits) while warmer temperatures have only marginally intensified the drought. However, the warmer temperatures over the high‐elevation areas during the wet season have contributed equally or more than the precipitation deficits to the reduction of snowpack. The interplay between temperature and precipitation anomalies in space and time also appears to be important for the drought development.

	abstract = {Abstract. Framed within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) of the European Commission, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is producing an enhanced global dataset for the land component of the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5), hereafter referred to as ERA5-Land. Once completed, the period covered will span from 1950 to the present, with continuous updates to support land monitoring applications. ERA5-Land describes the evolution of the water and energy cycles over land in a consistent manner over the production period, which, among others, could be used to analyse trends and anomalies. This is achieved through global high-resolution numerical integrations of the ECMWF land surface model driven by the downscaled meteorological forcing from the ERA5 climate reanalysis, including an elevation correction for the thermodynamic near-surface state. ERA5-Land shares with ERA5 most of the parameterizations that guarantees the use of the state-of-the-art land surface modelling applied to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. A main advantage of ERA5-Land compared to ERA5 and the older ERA-Interim is the horizontal resolution, which is enhanced globally to 9 km compared to 31 km (ERA5) or 80 km (ERA-Interim), whereas the temporal resolution is hourly as in ERA5. Evaluation against independent in situ observations and global model or satellite-based reference datasets shows the added value of ERA5-Land in the description of the hydrological cycle, in particular with enhanced soil moisture and lake description, and an overall better agreement of river discharge estimations with available observations. However, ERA5-Land snow depth fields present a mixed performance when compared to those of ERA5, depending on geographical location and altitude. The description of the energy cycle shows comparable results with ERA5. Nevertheless, ERA5-Land reduces the global averaged root mean square error of the skin temperature, taking as reference MODIS data, mainly due to the contribution of coastal points where spatial resolution is important. Since January 2020, the ERA5-Land period available has extended from January 1981 to the near present, with a 2- to 3-month delay with respect to real time. The segment prior to 1981 is in production, aiming for a release of the whole dataset in summer/autumn 2021. The high spatial and temporal resolution of ERA5-Land, its extended period, and the consistency of the fields produced makes it a valuable dataset to support hydrological studies, to initialize NWP and climate models, and to support diverse applications dealing with water resource, land, and environmental management.

	abstract = {Abstract. A decade-long (2010–2020) period with precipitation deficits in central–south Chile (30–41∘ S), the so-called megadrought (MD), has led to streamflow depletions of larger amplitude than expected from precipitation anomalies, indicating an intensification in drought propagation. We analysed the catchment characteristics and runoff mechanisms modulating such intensification by using the CAMELS-CL dataset and simulations from the HBV hydrological model. We compared annual precipitation–runoff (P–R) relationships before and during the MD across 106 basins with varying snow-/rainfall regimes and identified those catchments where drought propagation was intensified. Our results show that catchments' hydrological memory – modulated by snow and groundwater – is a key control of drought propagation. Snow-dominated catchments (30–35∘ S) feature larger groundwater contribution to streamflow than pluvial basins, which we relate to the infiltration of snowmelt over the Western Andean Front. This leads to longer memory in these basins, represented by a significative correlation between autumn streamflow (when snow has already melted) and the precipitation from the preceding year. Hence, under persistent drought conditions, snow-dominated catchments accumulate the effects of precipitation deficits and progressively generate less water, compared with their historical behaviour, notably affecting central Chile, a region with limited water supply and which concentrates most of the country's population and water demands. Finally, we addressed a general question: what is worse – an extreme single-year drought or a persistent moderate drought? In snow-dominated basins, where water provision strongly depends on both the current and previous precipitation seasons, an extreme drought induces larger absolute streamflow deficits; however persistent deficits induce a more intensified propagation of the meteorological drought. Hence, the worst scenario would be an extreme meteorological drought following consecutive years of precipitation below average, as occurred in 2019. In pluvial basins of southern Chile
(35–41∘ S), hydrologic memory is still an important factor, but water supply is more strongly dependant on the meteorological conditions of the current year, and therefore an extreme drought would have a higher impact on water supply than a persistent but moderate drought.},

            This paper evaluates the relationship between fire occurrence (number and burned area) and climate variability (precipitation and maximum temperatures) across central and south‐central Chile (32°–43° S) during recent decades (1976–2013). This region sustains the largest proportion of the Chilean population, contains ecologically important remnants of endemic ecosystems, the largest extension of forest exotic plantations, and concentrates most of the fire activity in the country. Fire activity in central Chile was mainly associated with above‐average precipitation during winter of the previous year and with dry conditions during spring to summer. The later association was particularly strong in the southern, wetter part of the study region. Maximum temperature had a positive significant relationship with burned area across the study region, with stronger correlations toward the south. Fires in central Chile were significantly related to El Niño–Southern Oscillation, through rainfall anomalies during the year previous to the fire season. The Antarctic Oscillation during winter through summer was positively related to fires across the study area due to drier/warmer conditions associated with the positive polarity of this oscillation. Climate change projections for the region reveal an all‐season decrease in precipitation and increases in temperature, that may likely result in an increment of the occurrence and the area affected by fires, as it has been observed during a multi‐year drought afflicting central Chile since 2010.},

              Traditional, mainstream definitions of drought describe it as deficit in water‐related variables or water‐dependent activities (e.g., precipitation, soil moisture, surface and groundwater storage, and irrigation) due to natural variabilities that are out of the control of local decision‐makers. Here, we argue that within coupled human‐water systems, drought must be defined and understood as a
              process
              as opposed to a
              product
              to help better frame and describe the complex and interrelated dynamics of both natural and human‐induced changes that define
              anthropogenic drought
              as a compound multidimensional and multiscale phenomenon, governed by the combination of natural water variability, climate change, human decisions and activities, and altered micro‐climate conditions due to changes in land and water management. This definition considers the full spectrum of dynamic feedbacks and processes (e.g., land‐atmosphere interactions and water and energy balance) within human‐nature systems that drive the development of
              anthropogenic drought
              . This process magnifies the water supply demand gap and can lead to water bankruptcy, which will become more rampant around the globe in the coming decades due to continuously growing water demands under compounding effects of climate change and global environmental degradation. This challenge has de facto implications for both short‐term and long‐term water resources planning and management, water governance, and policymaking. Herein, after a brief overview of the anthropogenic drought concept and its examples, we discuss existing research gaps and opportunities for better understanding, modeling, and management of this phenomenon.

              This article reviews research and progress on the notion of
              anthropogenic drought
              broadly defined as drought events caused or intensified by human activities. Most commonly used drought definitions are based on deficit in hydrologic/meteorologic drivers such as precipitation and runoff. Within coupled human‐water systems, however, drought must be defined and understood as the complex and interrelated dynamics of both natural and human‐induced changes. This
              anthropogenic drought
              definition considers the full spectrum of dynamic feedbacks and processes (e.g., land‐atmosphere interactions and water and energy balance) within human‐nature systems. Ideally,
              anthropogenic drought
              and the corresponding human interactions should be incorporated in models that include land‐atmosphere interactions, water balance, and energy balance. In this article, we review existing research gaps and opportunities for better understanding, modeling, and management of this phenomenon.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Drought, widely studied as an important driver of ecosystem dynamics, is predicted to increase in frequency and severity globally. To study drought, ecologists must define or at least operationalize what constitutes a drought. How this is accomplished in practice is unclear, particularly given that climatologists have long struggled to agree on definitions of drought, beyond general variants of “an abnormal deficiency of water.” We conducted a literature review of ecological drought studies (564 papers) to assess how ecologists describe and study drought. We found that ecologists characterize drought in a wide variety of ways (reduced precipitation, low soil moisture, reduced streamflow, etc.), but relatively few publications ({\textasciitilde}32\%) explicitly define what are, and are not, drought conditions. More troubling, a surprising number of papers ({\textasciitilde}30\%) simply equated “dry conditions” with “drought” and provided little characterization of the drought conditions studied. For a subset of these, we calculated Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index values for the reported drought periods. We found that while almost 90\% of the studies were conducted under conditions quantifiable as slightly to extremely drier than average, {\textasciitilde}50\% were within the range of normal climatic variability. We conclude that the current state of the ecological drought literature hinders synthesis and our ability to draw broad ecological inferences because drought is often declared but is not explicitly defined or well characterized. We suggest that future drought publications provide at least one of the following: (a) the climatic context of the drought period based on long‐term records; (b) standardized climatic index values; (c) published metrics from drought‐monitoring organizations; (d) a quantitative definition of what the authors consider to be drought conditions for their system. With more detailed and consistent quantification of drought conditions, comparisons among studies can be more rigorous, increasing our understanding of the ecological effects of drought.},

            Since June, 2018, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow‐On (GRACE‐FO) is extending the 15‐year monthly mass change record of the GRACE mission, which ended in June 2017. The GRACE‐FO instrument and flight system performance has improved over GRACE. Better attitude solutions and enhanced pointing performance result in reduced fuel consumption and gravity range rate post‐fit residuals. One accelerometer requires additional calibrations due to unexpected measurement noise. The GRACE‐FO gravity and mass change fields from June 2018 through December 2019 continue the GRACE record at an equivalent precision and spatiotemporal sampling. During this period, GRACE‐FO observed large interannual terrestrial water variations associated with excess rainfall (Central US, Middle East), drought (Europe, Australia), and ice melt (Greenland). These observations are consistent with independent mass change estimates, providing high confidence that no intermission biases exist from GRACE to GRACE‐FO, despite the 11‐month gap. GRACE‐FO has also successfully demonstrated satellite‐to‐satellite laser ranging interferometry.

            Plain Language Summary
            Mass change is a fundamental climate system indicator and provides an integrated global view of how Earth's water cycle and energy balance are evolving. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission monitored mass changes every month from 2002 through 2017. Since June 2018, GRACE Follow‐On (GRACE‐FO) continues this data record, tracking and monitoring changes in ice sheets and glaciers, near‐surface and underground water storage, as well as changes in sea level and ocean currents. GRACE‐FO instruments have been successfully calibrated and are providing new monthly mass change observations at a consistent spatial resolution and data quality with GRACE. Since its launch, GRACE‐FO has measured record land water storage changes in 2018 and 2019 in response to extreme heat waves and droughts over Europe and Australia, as well as to extreme rainfall events over the United States and Middle East. In the summer of 2019, GRACE‐FO measured record‐level Greenland mass loss rates. A novel laser ranging interferometer was successfully demonstrated on GRACE‐FO, laying the groundwork for improved future satellite gravity observations.

            The availability of terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) supports many hydrological applications. Five TWSA products are operational and publicly available, including three based on mass concentration (mascon) solutions and two based on the synthesis of spherical harmonic coefficients (SHCs). The mascon solutions have advantages regarding the synthesis of SHCs since the basis functions are represented locally rather than globally, which allows geophysical data constraints. Alternative new solutions based on SHCs are, therefore, critical and warranted to enrich the portfolio of user-friendly TWSA data based on different algorithms. TWSA data based on novel processing protocols is presented with a spatial re-sampling of 0.25 arc-degrees covering 2002–2022. This approach parameterizes the improved point mass (IPM) and adopts the synthesized residual gravitational potential as observations. The assay indicates that the proposed Hohai University (HHU-) IPM TWSA data reliably agree with the mascon solutions. The presented HHU-IPM TWSA data set would be instrumental in regional hydrological applications, particularly enabling improved assessment of regional water budgets.},

              Given the success of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission in mapping terrestrial water storage (TWS) since 2002, recent reconstructions of long‐term TWS rely on the use of statistical machine learning to apply GRACE‐derived information to past decades. Evaluating the interannual accuracy during nonobservational periods is a key challenge. This study develops a comprehensive framework to discuss the interannual accuracy of three different TWS reconstructions during 1981–2019, including (a) global‐scale accuracy assessment using GRACE and satellite laser ranging data; (b) regional‐scale accuracy testing across various underlying surfaces (i.e., rivers, lakes, and glaciers); and (c) investigation of relevant evidence from other Earth subsystems (i.e., historic climate events, sea level budget, and polar motion). Among the three reconstructions, the one that additionally corrects glacial TWS changes (REC2) detects a breaking point in the 1990s and further closes the interannual sea level budget with an absolute difference reduction to 5.13 mm; the reconstruction that is forced by local meteorological conditions (REC1), accounting for 54\% of the GRACE‐derived signal energy, underestimates glacial TWS variability but outperforms the other reconstructions in reproducing lake levels, basin‐scale water balances, and climate events at the interannual scale, while the others consider 95\%–99\% of the GRACE‐derived signal energy. The relatively high accuracy of REC1 (and REC2) in reflecting interannual changes in nonglacial (and glacial) regions is further confirmed by explaining the

            Land water storage plays a key role for the Earth’s climate, natural ecosystems, and human activities. Since the launch of the first Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission in 2002, spaceborne observations of changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS) have provided a unique, global perspective on natural and human-induced changes in freshwater resources. Even though they have become much used within the broader Earth system science community, space-based TWS datasets still incorporate important and case-specific limitations which may not always be clear to users not familiar with the underlying processing algorithms. Here, we provide an accessible and illustrated overview of the measurement concept, of the main available data products, and of some frequently encountered technical terms and concepts. We summarize concrete recommendations on how to use TWS data in combination with other hydrological or climatological datasets, and guidance on how to avoid possible pitfalls. Finally, we provide an overview of some of the main applications of GRACE TWS data in the fields of hydrology and climate science. This review is written with the intention of supporting future research and facilitating the use of satellite-based terrestrial water storage datasets in interdisciplinary contexts.},

	abstract = {Livestock plays an important economic role in Niger, especially in the semi-arid regions, while being highly vulnerable as a result of the large inter-annual variability of precipitation and, hence, rangeland production. This study aims to support effective rangeland management by developing an approach for mapping rangeland biomass production. The observed spatiotemporal variability of biomass production is utilised to build a model based on ground and remote sensing data for the period 2001 to 2015. Once established, the model can also be used to estimate herbaceous biomass for the current year at the end of the season without the need for new ground data. The phenology-based seasonal cumulative Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (cNDVI), computed from 10-day image composites of the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data, was used as proxy for biomass production. A linear regression model was fitted with multi-annual field measurements of herbaceous biomass at the end of the growing season. In addition to a general model utilising all available sites for calibration, different aggregation schemes (i.e., grouping of sites into calibration units) of the study area with a varying number of calibration units and different biophysical meaning were tested. The sampling sites belonging to a specific calibration unit of a selected scheme were aggregated to compute the regression. The different aggregation schemes were evaluated with respect to their predictive power. The results gathered at the different aggregation levels were subjected to cross-validation (cv), applying a jackknife technique (leaving out one year at a time). In general, the model performance increased with increasing model parameterization, indicating the importance of additional unobserved and spatially heterogeneous agro-ecological effects (which might relate to grazing, species composition, optical soil properties, etc.) in modifying the relationship between cNDVI and herbaceous biomass at the end of the season. The biophysical aggregation scheme, the calibration units for which were derived from an unsupervised ISODATA classification utilising 10-day NDVI images taken between January 2001 and December 2015, showed the best performance in respect to the predictive power (R2cv = 0.47) and the cross-validated root-mean-square error (398 kg·ha−1) values, although it was not the model with the highest number of calibration units. The proposed approach can be applied for the timely production of maps of estimated biomass at the end of the growing season before field measurements are made available. These maps can be used for the improved management of rangeland resources, for decisions on fire prevention and aid allocation, and for the planning of more in-depth field missions.},

Two attributes of the seasonal dynamics of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); the annual mean (NDVI mean), an indicator of light interception and hence of total C gains and the intra-annual Coefficient of Variation of the NDVI (NDVI CV), a descriptor of seasonality; were combined into an ES provision index (ESPI=NDVImean * (1-NDVICV)). The proportion of the variance in ES provision explained by the ESPI varied from 0.484 for avian richness up to 0.662 for C sequestration. A relatively large proportion of the studied area presented changes in ES provision. A 32,4\% of the Semiarid Chaco and the Rio de la Plata grasslands presented significant (p{\textless}0.01) trends. Most of the trends (30.2\%) were negative, showing a decrease in ESPI.

	abstract = {THE RISING RISK OF DROUGHT. Droughts of the twenty-first century are characterized by hotter temperatures, longer duration, and greater spatial extent, and are increasingly exacerbated by human demands for water. This situation increases the vulnerability of ecosystems to drought, including a rise in drought-driven tree mortality globally (Allen et al. 2015) and anticipated ecosystem transformations from one state to another-for example, forest to a shrubland (Jiang et al. 2013). When a drought drives changes within ecosystems, there can be a ripple effect through human communities that depend on those ecosystems for critical goods and services (Millar and Stephenson 2015). For example, the "Millennium Drought" (2002-10) in Australia caused unanticipated losses to key services provided by hydrological ecosystems in the Murray-Darling basin-including air quality regulation, waste treatment, erosion prevention , and recreation. The costs of these losses exceeded AUD \$800 million, as resources were spent to replace these services and adapt to new drought-impacted ecosystems (Banerjee et al. 2013). Despite the high costs to both nature and people, current drought research, management, and policy perspectives often fail to evaluate how drought affects ecosystems and the "natural capital" they provide to human communities. Integrating these human and natural dimensions of drought is an essential step toward addressing the rising risk of drought in the twenty-first century. Part of the problem is that existing drought definitions describing meteorological drought impacts (agricultural, hydrological, and socioeconomic) view drought through a human-centric lens and do not fully address the ecological dimensions of drought.},

            Central Chile, home to more than 10 million inhabitants, has experienced an uninterrupted sequence of dry years since 2010 with mean rainfall deficits of 20–40\%. The so‐called Mega Drought (MD) is the longest event on record and with few analogues in the last millennia. It encompasses a broad area, with detrimental effects on water availability, vegetation and forest fires that have scaled into social and economical impacts. Observations and reanalysis data reveal that the exceptional length of the MD results from the prevalence of a circulation dipole‐hindering the passage of extratropical storms over central Chile—characterized by deep tropospheric anticyclonic anomalies over the subtropical Pacific and cyclonic anomalies over the Amundsen–Bellingshausen Sea. El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a major modulator of such dipole, but the MD has occurred mostly under ENSO‐neutral conditions, except for the winters of 2010 (La Niña) and 2015 (strong El Niño). Climate model simulations driven both with historical forcing (natural and anthropogenic) and observed global SST replicate the south Pacific dipole and capture part of the rainfall anomalies. Idealized numerical experiments suggest that most of the atmospheric anomalies emanate from the subtropical southwest Pacific, a region that has experienced a marked surface warming over the last decade. Such warming may excite atmospheric Rossby waves whose propagation intensifies the circulation pattern leading to dry conditions in central Chile. On the other hand, anthropogenic forcing (greenhouse gases concentration increase and stratospheric ozone depletion) and the associated positive trend of the Southern Annular Mode also contribute to the strength of the south Pacific dipole and hence to the intensity and longevity of the MD. Given the concomitance of the seemingly natural (ocean sourced) and anthropogenic forcing, we anticipate only a partial recovery of central Chile precipitation in the decades to come.},

The 2012 drought was one of the most extensive drought events in half a century, resulting in over USD 12 billion in economic loss in the United States and substantial indirect impacts on global food security and commodity prices. An important feature of the 2012 drought was rapid development and intensification in late spring/early summer, a critical time for crop development and investment planning. Drought prediction remains a major challenge because dynamical precipitation forecasts are highly uncertain, and their prediction skill is low. Using a probabilistic framework for drought forecasting based on the persistence property of accumulated soil moisture, this paper shows that the US drought of summer 2012 was predictable several months in advance. The presented drought forecasting framework provides the probability occurrence of drought based on climatology and near-past observations of soil moisture. The results indicate that soil moisture exhibits higher persistence than precipitation, and hence improves drought predictability.},

            Accurate and reliable drought monitoring is essential to drought mitigation efforts and reduction of social vulnerability. A variety of indices, such as the standardized precipitation index (SPI), are used for drought monitoring based on different indicator variables. Because of the complexity of drought phenomena in their causation and impact, drought monitoring based on a single variable may be insufficient for detecting drought conditions in a prompt and reliable manner. This study outlines a multivariate, multi-index drought monitoring framework, namely, the multivariate standardized drought index (MSDI), for describing droughts based on the states of precipitation and soil moisture. In this study, the MSDI is evaluated against U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) data as well as the commonly used standardized indices for drought monitoring, including detecting drought onset, persistence, and spatial extent across the continental United States. The results indicate that MSDI includes attractive properties, such as higher probability of drought detection, compared to individual precipitation and soil moisture–based drought indices. This study shows that the MSDI leads to drought information generally consistent with the USDM and provides additional information and insights into drought monitoring.},

            Drought and water scarcity are keywords for river basin management in water‐stressed regions. “Drought” is a natural hazard, caused by large‐scale climatic variability, and cannot be prevented by local water management. “Water scarcity” refers to the long‐term unsustainable use of water resources, which water managers can influence. Making the distinction between drought and water scarcity is not trivial, because they often occur simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an observation‐modeling framework to separate natural (drought) and human (water scarcity) effects on the hydrological system. The basis of the framework is simulation of the situation that would have occurred without human influence, the “naturalized” situation, using a hydrological model. The resulting time series of naturalized state variables and fluxes are then compared to observed time series. As second, more important and novel step, anomalies (i.e., deviations from a threshold) are determined from both time series and compared. We demonstrate the use of the proposed observation‐modeling framework in the Upper‐Guadiana catchment in Spain. Application of the framework to the period 1980–2000 shows that the impact of groundwater abstraction on the hydrological system was, on average, four times as high as the impact of drought. Water scarcity resulted in disappearance of the winter high‐flow period, even in relatively wet years, and a nonlinear response of groundwater. The proposed observation‐modeling framework helps water managers in water‐stressed regions to quantify the relative impact of drought and water scarcity on a transient basis and, consequently, to make decisions regarding adaptation to drought and combating water scarcity.},

            Dryland ecosystems may be especially vulnerable to expected 21st century increases in temperature and aridity because they are tightly controlled by moisture availability. However, climate impact assessments in drylands are difficult because ecological dynamics are dictated by drought conditions that are difficult to define and complex to estimate from climate conditions alone. In addition, precipitation projections vary substantially among climate models, enhancing variation in overall trajectories for aridity. Here, we constrain this uncertainty by utilizing an ecosystem water balance model to quantify drought conditions with recognized ecological importance, and by identifying changes in ecological drought conditions that are robust among climate models, defined here as when {\textgreater}90\% of models agree in the direction of change. Despite limited evidence for robust changes in precipitation, changes in ecological drought are robust over large portions of drylands in the United States and Canada. Our results suggest strong regional differences in long‐term drought trajectories, epitomized by chronic drought increases in southern areas, notably the Upper Gila Mountains and South‐Central Semi‐arid Prairies, and decreases in the north, particularly portions of the Temperate and West‐Central Semi‐arid Prairies. However, we also found that exposure to hot‐dry stress is increasing faster than mean annual temperature over most of these drylands, and those increases are greatest in northern areas. Robust shifts in seasonal drought are most apparent during the cool season; when soil water availability is projected to increase in northern regions and decrease in southern regions. The implications of these robust drought trajectories for ecosystems will vary geographically, and these results provide useful insights about the impact of climate change on these dryland ecosystems. More broadly, this approach of identifying robust changes in ecological drought may be useful for other assessments of climate impacts in drylands and provide a more rigorous foundation for making long‐term strategic resource management decisions.},

High-resolution datasets of drought metrics are essential for monitoring and quantifying the severity, duration, frequency, and spatial extent of droughts at regional and particularly local scales. However, current global drought indices are available only at a coarser spatial resolution ({\textgreater}50 km). To fill this gap, we developed four high-resolution (5 km) gridded drought records based on the standardized precipitation evaporation index (SPEI) covering the period 1981–2022. These multi-scale (1–48 months) SPEI indices are computed based on monthly precipitation (P) from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data (CHIRPS, version 2) and Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP, version 2.8), and potential evapotranspiration (PET) from the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM, version 3.7a) and hourly Potential Evapotranspiration (hPET). We generated four SPEI records based on all possible combinations of P and PET datasets: CHIRPS\_GLEAM, CHIRPS\_hPET, MSWEP\_GLEAM, and MSWEP\_hPET. These drought records were evaluated globally and exhibited excellent agreement with observation-based estimates of SPEI, root zone soil moisture, and vegetation health indices. The newly developed high-resolution datasets provide more detailed local information and can be used to assess drought severity for particular periods and regions and to determine global, regional, and local trends, thereby supporting the development of site-specific adaptation measures.

              Located in the subtropical monsoon climate area of China, the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) had been frequently affected by drought events recently. Based on standardized precipitation evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), the characteristics of drought in the YRB and the influence of drought on vegetation in different seasons were investigated by maximum correlation (
              R
              max
              ) between 1981 and 2015. The results showed that: (a) Droughts occurred frequently but had no obvious regularity in the YRB from 1981 to 2015. The drought intensity in autumn and winter were slightly higher than that in spring and summer. The autumn droughts in Sichuan Basin were the most serious, followed by the spring droughts in the middle and lower reaches of the YRB; (b) Annual SPEI series at 102 stations exhibited a downward trend and 72 stations exhibited an upward trend. There was no station showing a significant downward trend and two stations showing a significant upward trend. There was a drying trend in autumn and winter, and a wetting trend in spring and summer. The eastern area of the YRB shows a more arid trend in spring and autumn, as well as in the southwest in winter; (c) 90\% of YRB showed a significant positive correlation (
              p
               {\textless} .05) between SPEI and EVI during the growing season (March–October), and the vegetation was more sensitive to short‐term and medium‐term drought. However, there were spatial and seasonal differences in the impact of drought on vegetation. Different types of land cover had different responses to droughts. Grasslands and croplands were more sensitive to droughts, grasslands at low elevation was dominated by short‐term droughts, while at high elevation was influenced by medium‐long‐ and long‐term droughts. Croplands and woodlands were more vulnerable to short‐term droughts.},

            Pulses of tree mortality caused by drought have been reported recently in forests around the globe, but large-scale quantitative evidence is lacking for Europe. Analyzing high-resolution annual satellite-based canopy mortality maps from 1987 to 2016 we here show that excess forest mortality (i.e., canopy mortality exceeding the long-term mortality trend) is significantly related to drought across continental Europe. The relationship between water availability and mortality showed threshold behavior, with excess mortality increasing steeply when the integrated climatic water balance from March to July fell below −1.6 standard deviations of its long-term average. For −3.0 standard deviations the probability of excess canopy mortality was 91.6\% (83.8–97.5\%). Overall, drought caused approximately 500,000 ha of excess forest mortality between 1987 and 2016 in Europe. We here provide evidence that drought is an important driver of tree mortality at the continental scale, and suggest that a future increase in drought could trigger widespread tree mortality in Europe.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Drought events are projected to become more severe and frequent across many regions in the future, but their impacts will likely differ among ecosystems depending on their ability to maintain functioning during droughts, i.e., ecosystem resistance. Plant species have diverse strategies to cope with drought. As a result, divergent responses of different vegetation types for similar levels of drought severity have been observed. It remains unclear whether such divergence can be explained by different drought duration; co-occurring compounding effects, e.g., heat stress or memory effects; management practices; etc. Here, we provide a global synthesis of vegetation resistance to drought and heat using different proxies for vegetation condition, namely the vegetation optical depth (L-VOD) data from the ESA Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) passive L-band microwave mission and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and kernel normalized difference vegetation index (kNDVI) from NASA MODIS. Due to its longer wavelength, L-VOD has the advantage over more commonly used vegetation indices (such as kNDVI, EVI) in that it provides different information on vegetation structure and biomass and suffers from less saturation over dense forests. We apply a linear model accounting for drought and temperature effects to characterize ecosystem resistance by their sensitivity to drought duration and temperature anomalies. We analyze how ecosystem resistance varies with land cover across the globe and investigate the potential effects of forest management and crop irrigation. We compare estimates of ecosystem resistance to drought and heat as retrieved from L-VOD, kNDVI, and EVI products. We find that regions with higher forest fraction show stronger ecosystem resistance to extreme droughts than cropland for all three vegetation proxies. L-VOD indicates that primary forests tend to be more resistant to drought events than secondary forests when controlling for the differences in background climate, but this cannot be detected in EVI and kNDVI. The difference is possibly related to EVI and kNDVI saturation in dense forests. In tropical primary evergreen broadleaf forests, old-growth trees tend to be more resistant to drought than young trees from L-VOD and kNDVI. Irrigation increases the drought resistance of cropland substantially. Forest harvest decreases the drought resistance of forests. Our results suggest that ecosystem resistance can be better monitored using L-VOD in dense forests and highlight the role of forest cover, forest management, and irrigation in determining ecosystem resistance to droughts.},

              Year-to-year changes in carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems have an essential role in determining atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations
              1
              . It remains uncertain to what extent temperature and water availability can explain these variations at the global scale
              2–5
              . Here we use factorial climate model simulations
              6
              and show that variability in soil moisture drives 90 per cent of the inter-annual variability in global land carbon uptake, mainly through its impact on photosynthesis. We find that most of this ecosystem response occurs indirectly as soil moisture–atmosphere feedback amplifies temperature and humidity anomalies and enhances the direct effects of soil water stress. The strength of this feedback mechanism explains why coupled climate models indicate that soil moisture has a dominant role
              4
              , which is not readily apparent from land surface model simulations and observational analyses
              2,5

            Quantifying the dynamics of land use change is critical in tackling global societal challenges such as food security, climate change, and biodiversity loss. Here we analyse the dynamics of global land use change at an unprecedented spatial resolution by combining multiple open data streams (remote sensing, reconstructions and statistics) to create the HIstoric Land Dynamics Assessment + (HILDA +). We estimate that land use change has affected almost a third (32\%) of the global land area in just six decades (1960-2019) and, thus, is around four times greater in extent than previously estimated from long-term land change assessments. We also identify geographically diverging land use change processes, with afforestation and cropland abandonment in the Global North and deforestation and agricultural expansion in the South. Here, we show that observed phases of accelerating ({\textasciitilde}1960–2005) and decelerating (2006–2019) land use change can be explained by the effects of global trade on agricultural production.},

We contrast the impact of LULCC on extremes with the impact of an increase in atmospheric CO2 from 280 ppmv to 375 ppmv. In general, consistent changes in both high and low temperature extremes are similar to the simulated change in mean temperature caused by LULCC and are restricted to regions of intense modification. The impact of LULCC on both means and on most temperature extremes is statistically significant. While the magnitude of the LULCC-induced change in the extremes can be of similar magnitude to the response to the change in CO2, the impacts of LULCC are much more geographically isolated. For most models, the impacts of LULCC oppose the impact of the increase in CO2 except for one model where the CO2-caused changes in the extremes are amplified. While we find some evidence that individual models respond consistently to LULCC in the simulation of changes in rainfall and rainfall extremes, LULCC's role in affecting rainfall is much less clear and less commonly statistically significant, with the exception of a consistent impact over South East Asia. Since the simulated response of mean and extreme temperatures to LULCC is relatively large, we conclude that unless this forcing is included, we risk erroneous conclusions regarding the drivers of temperature changes over regions of intense LULCC.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Land cover (LC) determines the energy exchange, water and carbon cycle between Earth's spheres. Accurate LC information is a fundamental parameter for the environment and climate studies. Considering that the LC in China has been altered dramatically with the economic development in the past few decades, sequential and fine-scale LC monitoring is in urgent need. However, currently, fine-resolution annual LC dataset produced by the observational images is generally unavailable for China due to the lack of sufficient training samples and computational capabilities. To deal with this issue, we produced the first Landsat-derived annual China land cover dataset (CLCD) on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, which contains 30 m annual LC and its dynamics in China from 1990 to 2019. We first collected the training samples by combining stable samples extracted from China's land-use/cover datasets (CLUDs) and visually interpreted samples from satellite time-series data, Google Earth and Google Maps. Using 335 709 Landsat images on the GEE, several temporal metrics were constructed and fed to the random forest classifier to obtain classification results. We then proposed a post-processing method incorporating spatial–temporal filtering and logical reasoning to further improve the spatial–temporal consistency of CLCD. Finally, the overall accuracy of CLCD reached 79.31 \% based on 5463 visually interpreted samples. A further assessment based on 5131 third-party test samples showed that the overall accuracy of CLCD outperforms that of MCD12Q1, ESACCI\_LC, FROM\_GLC and GlobeLand30. Besides, we intercompared the CLCD with several Landsat-derived thematic products, which exhibited good consistencies with the Global Forest Change, the Global Surface Water, and three impervious surface products. Based on the CLCD, the trends and patterns of China's LC changes during 1985 and 2019 were revealed, such as expansion of impervious surface (+148.71 \%) and water (+18.39 \%), decrease in cropland (−4.85 \%) and grassland (−3.29 \%), and increase in forest (+4.34 \%). In general, CLCD reflected the rapid urbanization and a series of ecological projects (e.g. Gain for Green) in China and revealed the anthropogenic implications on LC under the condition of climate change, signifying its potential application in the global change research.

However, there is no consensus on whether flash droughts have become the new normal because slow droughts may also increase. In this study, we show that drought intensification rates have sped up over subseasonal time scales and that there has been a transition toward more flash droughts over 74\% of the global regions identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Extreme Events during the past 64 years. The transition is associated with amplified anomalies of evapotranspiration and precipitation deficit caused by anthropogenic climate change. In the future, the transition is projected to expand to most land areas, with larger increases under higher-emission scenarios. These findings underscore the urgency for adapting to faster-onset droughts in a warmer future.

              : Chilean vegetation has previously received considerable attention, and several classifications are currently available. The most recent of these was presented for the first time in 2006 and updated in 2017 by the authors. Although widely utilized by researchers both in Chile and Latin America, this information is only available in Spanish, which hampers its usefulness for a broader scientific audience. Here, we provide an overview of the methods and the resulting classification and propose a correspondence between Chilean classification and the International Vegetation Classification (IVC) following the EcoVeg scheme.
              Study area
              : Continental Chile.
              Methods
              : Based on the criteria of the EcoVeg approach, we established a linkage of zonal and azonal vegetation units to the macrogroup level and to the formation classes of the IVC. We also generated a map to facilitate crosswalk between the classifications.
              Results
              : We recognize 23 macrogroups, 13 divisions and 11 formations of zonal vegetation, including three newly proposed macrogroups, one division and one formation. We further recognize 23 macrogroups, 23 divisions and 17 formations of intrazonal vegetation. Together, they encompass all six formation classes of natural vegetation of the IVC. We highlight those units so far not mentioned for Chile in the IVC. Finally, we provide a map of macrogroups and discuss the limitations and prospects of this approach for the classification of Chilean vegetation.
              Conclusions
              : Chilean zonal vegetation was successfully accommodated in the IVC down to the macrogroup level. The process of linking Chilean zonal vegetation and macrogroups led us to a few suggestions that may be used to improve the IVC.

              This review examines the role of the atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) in drought. AED is a complex concept and here we discuss possible AED definitions, the subsequent metrics to measure and estimate AED, and the different physical drivers that control it. The complex influence of AED on meteorological, environmental/agricultural and hydrological droughts is discussed, stressing the important spatial differences related to the climatological conditions. Likewise, AED influence on drought has implications regarding how different drought metrics consider AED in their attempts to quantify drought severity. Throughout the article, we assess literature findings with respect to: (a) recent drought trends and future projections; (b) the several uncertainties related to data availability; (c) the sensitivity of current drought metrics to AED; and (d) possible roles that both the radiative and physiological effects of increasing atmospheric CO

Rather it calls for different evaluations of drought impacts and trends under future climate scenarios, considering the complex feedbacks governing the climate system.

            Flash droughts are characterized by rapid development and intensification, generating a new risk for drought impacts on natural and socio‐economic systems. In the current climate change scenario, the meteorological drivers involved in triggering flash droughts are uncertain. We analyzed the role of meteorological drivers underlying the development of flash droughts in Spain over the last six decades, evidencing that the effect of atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) on flash drought is mainly restricted to water‐limited regions and the warm season. However, the contribution of the AED has increased notably in recent years and particularly in summer (∼3.5\% per decade), thus becoming a decisive driver in explaining the occurrence of the latest flash droughts in some regions of Spain. Our findings have strong implications for proper understanding of the recent spatiotemporal behavior of flash droughts in Spain and illustrate how this type of event can be related to global warming processes.

            Plain Language Summary
            Flash drought is a complex phenomenon characterized by rapid development and intensification, which increases potential impacts on natural and socio‐economic systems. Nowadays, little is known about the role played by the meteorological drivers involved in triggering this type of events. In this study, we analyze the influence of these drivers on the development and intensification of flash droughts in Spain over the last six decades. We show that atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) plays a minor role compared to precipitation deficits. However, the contribution of the AED to flash drought development has increased notably in recent years. Our findings highlight the importance of AED role in explaining the occurrence of the latest flash droughts in Spain and how this type of event can be more and more related to global warming.

            Global vegetation and associated ecosystem services critically depend on soil moisture availability which has decreased in many regions during the last three decades. While spatial patterns of vegetation sensitivity to global soil water have been recently investigated, long-term changes in vegetation sensitivity to soil water availability are still unclear. Here we assess global vegetation sensitivity to soil moisture during 1982-2017 by applying explainable machine learning with observation-based leaf area index (LAI) and hydro-climate anomaly data. We show that LAI sensitivity to soil moisture significantly increases in many semi-arid and arid regions. LAI sensitivity trends are associated with multiple hydro-climate and ecological variables, and strongest increasing trends occur in the most water-sensitive regions which additionally experience declining precipitation. State-of-the-art land surface models do not reproduce this increasing sensitivity as they misrepresent water-sensitive regions and sensitivity strength. Our sensitivity results imply an increasing ecosystem vulnerability to water availability which can lead to exacerbated reductions in vegetation carbon uptake under future intensified drought, consequently amplifying climate change.},

            Global warming accelerates water cycle, causing more droughts globally that challenge monitoring and forecasting. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) is used to assess drought characteristics and response time of natural and economic systems at various timescales. However, existing SPEI datasets have coarse spatial or temporal resolution or limited spatial extent, restricting their ability to accurately identify the start or end dates or the extent of drought at the global scale. To narrow these gaps, we developed a global daily SPEI dataset (SPEI-GD), with a 0.25° spatial resolution from 1982 to 2021 at multiple timescales (5, 30, 90, 180 and 360 days), based on the precipitation from European Center for Medium Weather Forecasting Reanalysis V5 (ERA5) dataset and the potential evapotranspiration from Singer’s dataset. Compared to widely used SPEIbase dataset, the SPEI-GD can improve the spatial-temporal resolution and the accuracy of SPEI in areas where meteorological sites are lacking. The SPEI-GD significantly correlates with site-based SPEI and soil moisture. Our dataset solidly supports sub-seasonal and daily-scale global and regional drought research.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Increased flash drought awareness in recent years has motivated the development of numerous indicators for monitoring, early warning, and assessment. The flash drought indicators can act as a complementary set of tools by which to inform flash drought response and management. However, the limitations of each indicator much be measured and communicated between research and practitioners to ensure effectiveness. The limitations of any flash drought indicator are better understood and overcome through assessment of indicator sensitivity and consistency; however, such assessment cannot assume any single indicator properly represents the flash drought “truth.” To better understand the current state of flash drought monitoring, this study presents an intercomparison of nine, widely used flash drought indicators. The indicators represent perspectives and processes that are known to drive flash drought, including evapotranspiration and evaporative demand, precipitation, and soil moisture. We find no single flash drought indicator consistently outperforms all others across the contiguous United States. We do find the evaporative demand- and evapotranspiration-driven indicators tend to lead precipitation- and soil moisture-based indicators in flash drought onset, but also tend to produce more flash drought events collectively. Overall, the regional and definition-specific variability in results supports the argument for a multi-indicator approach for flash drought monitoring, as advocated by recent studies. Furthermore, flash drought research—especially evaluation of historical and potential future changes in flash drought characteristics—should test multiple indicators, datasets, and methods for representing flash drought, and ideally employ a multi-indicator analysis framework over use of a single indicator from which to infer all flash drought information.
            
              Significance Statement
              Rapid onset or “flash” drought has been an increasing concern globally, with quickly intensifying impacts to agriculture, ecosystems, and water resources. Many tools and indicators have been developed to monitor and provide early warning for flash drought, ideally resulting in more time for effective mitigation and reduced impacts. However, there remains no widely accepted single method for defining, monitoring, and measuring flash drought, which means most indicators that are developed are compared with other individual indicators or conditions and impacts in one or two flash drought events. In this study, we measure the state of flash drought monitoring through an intercomparison of nine, widely used flash drought indicators that represent different aspects of flash drought. We find that no single flash drought indicator outperformed all others and suggest that a comprehensive flash drought monitor should leverage multiple, complementary indicators, datasets, and methods. Furthermore, we suggest flash drought research—especially that which reflects on historical or projected changes in flash drought characteristics—should seek multiple indicators, datasets, and methods for analyses, thereby reducing the potentially confounding effects of sensitivity to a single indicator.},

              We investigated the use of a satellite‐derived vegetation index to detect changes in biomass productivity in different land management regimes in drylands of the Northern Negev.

Use of a reference site revealed the magnitude and direction of change in biomass productivity in the different land management regimes. Measures of soil organic matter confirmed these differences between the two managed sites and the reference site. We suggest that the use of abandoned lands for a reference may enhance the ability to detect changes in biomass productivity in drylands.},

              Empirical vegetation indices derived from spectral reflectance data are widely used in remote sensing of the biosphere, as they represent robust proxies for canopy structure, leaf pigment content, and, subsequently, plant photosynthetic potential. Here, we generalize the broad family of commonly used vegetation indices by exploiting all higher-order relations between the spectral channels involved. This results in a higher sensitivity to vegetation biophysical and physiological parameters. The presented nonlinear generalization of the celebrated normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) consistently improves accuracy in monitoring key parameters, such as leaf area index, gross primary productivity, and sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence. Results suggest that the statistical approach maximally exploits the spectral information and addresses long-standing problems in satellite Earth Observation of the terrestrial biosphere.

	abstract = {Abstract. Hydrological drought is increasingly studied using large-scale models. It is, however, not sure whether large-scale models reproduce the development of hydrological drought correctly. The pressing question is how well do large-scale models simulate the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought? To answer this question, we evaluated the simulation of drought propagation in an ensemble mean of ten large-scale models, both land-surface models and global hydrological models, that participated in the model intercomparison project of WATCH (WaterMIP). For a selection of case study areas, we studied drought characteristics (number of droughts, duration, severity), drought propagation features (pooling, attenuation, lag, lengthening), and hydrological drought typology (classical rainfall deficit drought, rain-to-snow-season drought, wet-to-dry-season drought, cold snow season drought, warm snow season drought, composite drought).  Drought characteristics simulated by large-scale models clearly reflected drought propagation; i.e. drought events became fewer and longer when moving through the hydrological cycle. However, more differentiation was expected between fast and slowly responding systems, with slowly responding systems having fewer and longer droughts in runoff than fast responding systems. This was not found using large-scale models. Drought propagation features were poorly reproduced by the large-scale models, because runoff reacted immediately to precipitation, in all case study areas. This fast reaction to precipitation, even in cold climates in winter and in semi-arid climates in summer, also greatly influenced the hydrological drought typology as identified by the large-scale models. In general, the large-scale models had the correct representation of drought types, but the percentages of occurrence had some important mismatches, e.g. an overestimation of classical rainfall deficit droughts, and an underestimation of wet-to-dry-season droughts and snow-related droughts. Furthermore, almost no composite droughts were simulated for slowly responding areas, while many multi-year drought events were expected in these systems.  We conclude that most drought propagation processes are reasonably well reproduced by the ensemble mean of large-scale models in contrasting catchments in Europe. Challenges, however, remain in catchments with cold and semi-arid climates and catchments with large storage in aquifers or lakes. This leads to a high uncertainty in hydrological drought simulation at large scales. Improvement of drought simulation in large-scale models should focus on a better representation of hydrological processes that are important for drought development, such as evapotranspiration, snow accumulation and melt, and especially storage. Besides the more explicit inclusion of storage in large-scale models, also parametrisation of storage processes requires attention, for example through a global-scale dataset on aquifer characteristics, improved large-scale datasets on other land characteristics (e.g. soils, land cover), and calibration/evaluation of the models against observations of storage (e.g. in snow, groundwater).},

            In recent years, large-scale tree mortality events linked to global change have occurred around the world. Current forest monitoring methods are crucial for identifying mortality hotspots, but systematic assessments of isolated or scattered dead trees over large areas are needed to reduce uncertainty on the actual extent of tree mortality. Here, we mapped individual dead trees in California using sub-meter resolution aerial photographs from 2020 and deep learning-based dead tree detection. We identified 91.4 million dead trees over 27.8 million hectares of vegetated areas (16.7-24.7\% underestimation bias when compared to field data). Among these, a total of 19.5 million dead trees appeared isolated, and 60\% of all dead trees occurred in small groups ( ≤ 3 dead trees within a 30 × 30 m grid), which is largely undetected by other state-level monitoring methods. The widespread mortality of individual trees impacts the carbon budget and sequestration capacity of California forests and can be considered a threat to forest health and a fuel source for future wildfires.},

	abstract = {Chile is positioned in the 20th rank of water availability per capita. Nonetheless, water security levels vary across the territory. Around 70\% of the national population lives in arid and semiarid regions, where a persistent drought has been experienced over the last decade. This has led to water security problems including water shortages. The water allocation and trading system in Chile is based on a water use rights (WURs) market, with limited regulatory and supervisory mechanisms, where the volume to be granted as permanent and eventual WURs is calculated from statistical analyses of historical streamflow records if available, or from empirical estimations if they are not. This computation of WURs does not consider the nonstationarity of hydrological processes nor climatic projections. This study presents the first large sample diagnosis of water allocation system in Chile under climate change scenarios. This is based on novel anthropic intervention indices (IAI), which were computed as the ratio between the total granted water volume to the water availability within 87 basins in north-central and southern Chile (30°S–42°S). The IAI were evaluated for the historical period (1979–2019) and under modeled-based climatic projections (2055–2080). According to these IAI levels, to date, there are 20 out of 87 overallocated basins, which under the assumption that no further WURs will be granted in the future, increases up to 25 basins for the 2055–2080 period. The results show that, to date most of north-central Chilean catchments already have a large anthropic intervention degree, and the increases for the future period occurs mostly in the southern region of the country (approximately 38°S), which has been considered as possible source of water for large water transfer projects (i.e., water roads). These indices and diagnosis are proposed as a tool to help policy makers to address water scarcity under climate change.},

The MD conditions, combined with intensive agricultural activities and the current water management system, have led to water scarcity problems in Mediterranean and Semi-arid regions of Chile. An emblematic case is the Petorca basin, where a water crisis is undergone. To characterize this crisis, we analyzed water provision by using tree-ring records, remote sensing, instrumental data, and allocated water rights within the basin. Results indicate that the MD is the most severe dry period over the last 700-years of streamflow reconstruction. During the MD, streamflow and water bodies of the upper parts of the basin have been less affected than mid and low areas of this valley, where consumptive withdrawals reach up to 18\% of the mean annual precipitation. This extracted volume is similar to the MD mean annual precipitation deficits. The impacts of the current drought, along with the drier climate projections for Central Chile, emphasize the urgency for faster policy changes related to water provision. Climate change adaptation plans and policies should enhance the current monitoring network and the public control of water use to secure the water access for inhabitants and productive activities.},

In north-central Chile, there has been GW depletion as a result of semi-arid conditions and high water demand, which has unleashed major social conflicts, some due to drought and others due to agribusiness practices against the backdrop of a private water management model. The Ligua and Petorca watersheds in the Valparaíso Region were studied in order to analyze the influence of climatic and anthropogenic factors on aquifer depletion using an interdisciplinary approach that integrates hydroclimatic variables, remote sensing data techniques, and GW rights data to promote sustainable GW management. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated and the 2002–2017 land-use change was analyzed. It was shown that GW decreased significantly (in 75\% of the wells) and that the hydrological drought was moderate and prolonged (longest drought in the last 36 years). The avocado-growing area in Ligua increased significantly—by 2623 ha—with respect to other agricultural areas (higher GW decrease), while in Petorca, it decreased by 128 ha. In addition, GW-rainfall correlations were low and GW rights were granted continuously despite the drought. The results confirmed that aquifer depletion was mostly influenced by human factors due to overexploitation by agriculture and a lack of water management.},

              Forest plantations in Chile occupy more than 2.2 million ha and are responsible for 2.1\% of the GDP of the country's economy. The ability to accurately predictions of plantations productivity under current and future climate has an impact can enhance on forest management and industrial wood production. The use of process‐based models to predict forest growth has been instrumental in improving the understanding and quantifying the effects of climate variability, climate change, and the impact of atmospheric CO

              concentration and management practices on forest growth. This study uses the 3‐PG model to predict future forest productivity
              Eucalyptus globulus
              and
              Pinus radiata
              . The study integrates climate data from global circulation models used in CMIP5 for scenarios RCP26 and RCP85, digital soil maps for physical and chemical variables. Temporal and spatial tree growth inventories were used to compare with the 3‐PG predictions. The results indicated that forest productivity is predicted to potentially increase stand volume (SV) over the next 50 years by 26\% and 24\% for the RCP26 scenario and between 73\% and 62\% for the RCP85 scenario for
              E. globulus
              and
              P. radiata
              , respectively. The predicted increases can be explained by a combination of higher level of atmospheric CO
              2
              , air temperatures closer to optimum than current, and increases in tree water use efficiency. If the effect of CO
              2
              is not considered, the predicted differences of SV for 2070 are 16\% and 14\% for the RCP26 scenario and 22\% and 14\% for RCP85 for the two species. While shifts in climate and increasing CO
              2
              are likely to benefit promote higher productivity, other factors such as lack insufficient availability of soil nutrients, events such as increasing frequency and duration of droughts, longer periods of extreme temperatures, competing vegetation, and occurrence of new pests and diseases may compromise these potential gains.},

                The radial‐growth response of
                P. uviferum
                climate was highly variable across its full latitudinal distribution. There was a long‐term and positive association between radial growth and higher moisture at the northern and southern edges of the distribution of this species and the opposite relationship for the core of its distribution, especially following the climatic shifts of the 1950s and 1970s. In addition, non‐stationarity in moisture‐radial growth relationships was observed in all three latitudinal groups (southern and northern edges and core) for all seasons during the 20th century.
              
            
            
              Main conclusions
              
                Climate shifts in southern South America in the 1950s and 1970s resulted in different responses in the mean radial growth of
                P. uviferum
                at the southern and northern edges and at the core of its range. Dendroclimatic analyses document that during the first half of the 20th century climate‐growth relationships were relatively similar between the southern and northern range edges but diverged after the 1950s. Our findings imply that simulated projections of climate impacts on tree growth, and by implication on forest ecosystem productivity, derived from models of past climate‐growth relationships need to carefully consider different and non‐stationarity responses along the wide latitudinal distribution of this species.},

              Background and Aims
              The vulnerability and responsiveness of forests to drought are immensely variable across biomes. Intraspecific tree responses to drought in species with wide niche breadths that grow across contrasting climatically environments might provide key information regarding forest resistance and changes in species distribution under climate change. Using a species with an exceptionally wide niche breath, we tested the hypothesis that tree populations thriving in dry environments are more resistant to drought than those growing in moist locations.
            
            
              Methods
              We determined temporal trends in tree radial growth of 12 tree populations of Nothofagus antarctica (Nothofagaceae) located across a sharp precipitation gradient (annual precipitation of 500–2000 mm) in Chile and Argentina. Using dendrochronological methods, we fitted generalized additive mixed-effect models to predict the annual basal area increment as a function of year and dryness (De Martonne aridity index). We also measured carbon and oxygen isotope signals (and estimated intrinsic water-use efficiency) to provide potential physiological causes for tree growth responses to drought.
            
            
              Key Results
              We found unexpected improvements in growth during 1980–1998 in moist sites, while growth responses in dry sites were mixed. All populations, independent of site moisture, showed an increase in their intrinsic water-use efficiency in recent decades, a tendency that seemed to be explained by an increase in the photosynthetic rate instead of drought-induced stomatal closure, given that δ18O did not change with time.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The absence of drought-induced negative effects on tree growth in a tree species with a wide niche breadth is promising because it might relate to the causal mechanisms tree species possess to face ongoing drought events. We suggest that the drought resistance of N. antarctica might be attributable to its low stature and relatively low growth rate.},

              It is widely accepted that global warming is affecting forests near the tree line by increasing tree growth in these cold‐limited environments. However, since about 1970, a reduction in tree growth near the tree line has been observed in response to warming and increased drought stress. This reduction in tree growth has been mainly reported in forests of the northern hemisphere but less studied in southern forests. In this study, we investigated tree populations of
              Nothofagus pumilio
              located near the arboreal altitudinal limit in the central Patagonian Andes (45–47° S, Aysén region, Chile). In this region, warming has been accompanied by increased drought conditions since the 2000s. We explored whether this climatic variability has promoted or reduced tree growth at the regional scale in tree lines of these broadleaved temperate forests of central Patagonia. We constructed tree‐ring chronologies and determined common growth patterns and trends, and then analyzed the influence of recent climate. We detected a significant change in the slope of regional growth trends between the periods 1955–1985 and 1985–2015. We found that positive growth trends in the period 1955–1985 were associated with warmer and drier springs. However, after 1985, we found a stabilization in
              N. pumilio
              growth associated with a steady increase in temperature in autumn. Our results support the idea that more frequent warm autumns, with very thin or no snow cover, have stabilized tree growth due to water deficit at the end of the growing season of
              N. pumilio
              . The predicted climate change scenario of increasing temperatures and drought in central Patagonia may increase competition among trees for water, particularly at the end of the growing season. Consequently, we could expect a decreasing forest growth trend in central Patagonia, potentially impacting forest dynamics of these southern forests.},

            Land-use change affects the provision of ecosystem services and wildlife habitat. We project land-use change from 2001 to 2051 for the contiguous United States under two scenarios reflecting continuation of 1990s trends and high crop demand more reflective of the recent past. These scenarios result in large differences in land-use trajectories that generate increases in carbon storage, timber production, food production from increased yields (even with declines in cropland area), and {\textgreater}10\% decreases in habitat for one-quarter of modeled species. We analyzed three policy alternatives that provide incentives to maintain and expand forest cover, conserve natural habitats, and limit urban sprawl. Policy interventions need to be aggressive to significantly alter underlying land-use trends and shift the trajectory of ecosystem service provision.
          , 
            Providing food, timber, energy, housing, and other goods and services, while maintaining ecosystem functions and biodiversity that underpin their sustainable supply, is one of the great challenges of our time. Understanding the drivers of land-use change and how policies can alter land-use change will be critical to meeting this challenge. Here we project land-use change in the contiguous United States to 2051 under two plausible baseline trajectories of economic conditions to illustrate how differences in underlying market forces can have large impacts on land-use with cascading effects on ecosystem services and wildlife habitat. We project a large increase in croplands (28.2 million ha) under a scenario with high crop demand mirroring conditions starting in 2007, compared with a loss of cropland (11.2 million ha) mirroring conditions in the 1990s. Projected land-use changes result in increases in carbon storage, timber production, food production from increased yields, and {\textgreater}10\% decreases in habitat for 25\% of modeled species. We also analyze policy alternatives designed to encourage forest cover and natural landscapes and reduce urban expansion. Although these policy scenarios modify baseline land-use patterns, they do not reverse powerful underlying trends. Policy interventions need to be aggressive to significantly alter underlying land-use change trends and shift the trajectory of ecosystem service provision.},

              Aim
              To identify the main spatiotemporal patterns of tree growth responses to different time‐scales of drought at a hemispheric scale using a climate drought index and tree‐ring records, and to determine whether those patterns are driven by different climate and forest features.

              Methods
              
                We used a large‐scale dendrochronological data set of tree‐ring width series from 1657 sites and a time‐dependent drought index which incorporates information on precipitation and temperature variability (standardized precipitation–evapotranspiration index,
                SPEI
                ). Correlation analysis was used to quantify how tree growth responds to different drought time‐scales. Variation in the correlations was summarized using principal components analysis (
                PCA
                ) and the contribution of the various environmental factors was estimated using predictive discriminant analysis (
                PDA
                ).
              
            
            
              Results
              The period between the water shortage and the impact on tree growth differs noticeably among forest types and tree families. There is a gradient in the response of growth to drought including: (1) forests that do not respond to drought, such as those located in cold and very humid areas; (2) forests located in semi‐arid areas characterized by responses to long‐term droughts; (3) forests that respond to medium‐ to long‐term droughts subjected to subhumid conditions; and (4) forests that dominate humid sites and respond to short‐term droughts.
            
            
              Main conclusion
              Forests that experience semi‐arid and subhumid conditions tend to respond over longer time‐scales than those located in more humid areas. The characteristic time‐scale at which forest growth mainly responds to drought is a proxy for drought vulnerability, reflecting the trees' ability to cope with water deficits of different durations and severities.},

	abstract = {An understanding of drought characteristics is vital for sustainable management of water resources. This is particularly important for dry regions such as Australia where large‐scale water supply infrastructure has to be designed to withstand multiyear variability in rainfall anomalies. This study considers the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) at time scales of 3, 6, 12 and 24 months to assess both short‐term and long‐term droughts. Trends in the SPI at 46 selected rainfall stations across South Australia (SA) are investigated. Furthermore, various drought parameters such as frequency, severity and duration are estimated, and their spatial distributions are presented. Drought risks are estimated in terms of copula based bivariate joint return periods and compared with traditional univariate return periods. Finally, the dominant climatic modes of sustained drought and wet anomalies are identified using correlation analysis. Results show that 23 out of the 46 selected stations had a significantly negative trend for the 24 month SPI whereas the count is four for the 3 month SPI. This reveals that droughts have intensified over 1960–2010 and this intensification is more prominent for long‐term drought. Strong spatial variability is evident in drought parameters across SA. The results also highlight the suitability of a bivariate joint return period over a univariate return period for drought risk assessment because drought is a multi‐faceted phenomenon. Thus, drought risk estimated for the univariate return period was found to be different from the drought risk estimated by the bivariate return period. The dominant climatic modes identified in this study are Niño3.4 and the dipole mode index (DMI), which are able to represent the SPI across SA at the selected time scales. The outcomes of this study are useful for water managers and policy makers involved in sustainable water resource management.},

                  Water is a key resource in tropical savannas. Changes in vegetation structure due to land‐use change and increased fire frequency may affect the availability of water and the flux of water through these ecosystems.
                
                
                  We compared the seasonal soil moisture dynamics of two adjacent savanna ecosystems with contrasting tree densities in central Brazil. Our goal was to investigate the influence of tree density on deep water uptake, soil water dynamics and evapotranspiration.
                
                
                  
                    Soil water was measured using a depth of 7·5 m beneath the tree‐dominated
                    cerrado denso
                    ecosystem and to 4 m beneath the grass‐dominated
                    campo sujo
                    ecosystem. Plant‐available water (PAW) throughout the
                    cerrado denso
                    soil profile ranged from 293 mm at the end of the dry season to 689 mm during the wet season. In the grass‐dominated site, PAW in the profile ranged from 155 to 362 mm.
                  
                
                
                  
                    During the dry season, ≈82\% of the water used in
                    cerrado denso
                    and 67\% in
                    campo sujo
                    was extracted from the profile below 1 m. The tree‐dominated
                    cerrado denso
                    used 137 mm more water than the grass‐dominated
                    campo sujo
                    . Significant deep soil water uptake was also observed during the wet season of 1998, when rainfall was below average.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Evapotranspiration (ET) rates (estimated as change in soil moisture over time) were higher in
                    cerrado denso
                    than in
                    campo sujo
                    during both seasons. Estimated ET ranged from 1·4 mm day
                    −1
                    during the dry season to 5·8 mm day
                    −1
                    for the wet season in
                    cerrado denso
                    , and from 0·9 mm day
                    −1
                    in the dry season to 4·5 mm day
                    −1
                    in early wet season in
                    campo sujo
                    . The differences in PAW and ET rates between the two ecosystems are associated not only with differences in root distribution, but also with differences in tree densities and the phenology of full‐leaf canopies.
                  
                
                
                  Our results suggest that deep‐rooted plants may contribute significantly to the water balance of cerrado ecosystems, and that the hydrological cycle of this biome could change as woody vegetation is replaced by exotic grasses and agricultural crops.},

            Wildfires have profound impacts on forested ecosystems and rural communities. Increases in area burned by wildfires in the western United States have been widely attributed to reduced winter snowpack or increased summer temperatures. Trends in precipitation have previously been dismissed as has their feedback to regional temperature trends. We show that declines in summer precipitation and wetting rain days have likely been a primary driver of increases in wildfire area burned. Understanding the climatic drivers of fire activity is important for informing forest management. Our findings are consistent with future climate projections, which predict further decreases in summer precipitation and longer dry periods between rain events across much of the West.
          , 
            Western United States wildfire increases have been generally attributed to warming temperatures, either through effects on winter snowpack or summer evaporation. However, near-surface air temperature and evaporative demand are strongly influenced by moisture availability and these interactions and their role in regulating fire activity have never been fully explored. Here we show that previously unnoted declines in summer precipitation from 1979 to 2016 across 31–45\% of the forested areas in the western United States are strongly associated with burned area variations. The number of wetting rain days (WRD; days with precipitation ≥2.54 mm) during the fire season partially regulated the temperature and subsequent vapor pressure deficit (VPD) previously implicated as a primary driver of annual wildfire area burned. We use path analysis to decompose the relative influence of declining snowpack, rising temperatures, and declining precipitation on observed fire activity increases. After accounting for interactions, the net effect of WRD anomalies on wildfire area burned was more than 2.5 times greater than the net effect of VPD, and both the WRD and VPD effects were substantially greater than the influence of winter snowpack. These results suggest that precipitation during the fire season exerts the strongest control on burned area either directly through its wetting effects or indirectly through feedbacks to VPD. If these trends persist, decreases in summer precipitation and the associated summertime aridity increases would lead to more burned area across the western United States with far-reaching ecological and socioeconomic impacts.},

              Results
              
                Across locations, the patterns of tree line growth occurring in the 1980–2010 period exhibited a clear and significant negative trend, in contrast to the previous 1950–1980 period. We found an increase in
                iWUE
                and δ
                18
                O across time and locations. Given that an increase in δ
                18
                O indicates a decrease in stomatal conductance, we assert that drought‐induced stomatal closure appears to be causing the reduction in growth.
              
            
            
              Main conclusions
              
                We show unequivocal evidence that warmer and drier summer conditions translated into a decrease in growth rates along the elevational tree line of the southern Andes, reverting previous growth improvements linked to climate warming. An improvement in
                iWUE
                at all locations is most likely explained by decreased stomatal conductance given the rising δ
                18
                O signal. An
                iWUE
                –growth decoupling may act as an ecological strategy to respond to drought.},

            The historical course of evolutionary diversification shapes the current distribution of biodiversity, but the main forces constraining diversification are still a subject of debate. We unveil the evolutionary structure of tree species assemblages across the Americas to assess whether an inability to move or an inability to evolve is the predominant constraint in plant diversification and biogeography. We find a fundamental divide in tree lineage composition between tropical and extratropical environments, defined by the absence versus presence of freezing temperatures. Within the Neotropics, we uncover a further evolutionary split between moist and dry forests. Our results demonstrate that American tree lineages tend to retain their ancestral environmental relationships and that phylogenetic niche conservatism is the primary force structuring the distribution of tree biodiversity. Our study establishes the pervasive importance of niche conservatism to community assembly even at intercontinental scales.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Global patterns of regional (gamma) plant diversity are relatively well known, but whether these patterns hold for local communities, and the dependence on spatial grain, remain controversial. Using data on 170,272 georeferenced local plant assemblages, we created global maps of alpha diversity (local species richness) for vascular plants at three different spatial grains, for forests and non-forests. We show that alpha diversity is consistently high across grains in some regions (for example, Andean-Amazonian foothills), but regional ‘scaling anomalies’ (deviations from the positive correlation) exist elsewhere, particularly in Eurasian temperate forests with disproportionally higher fine-grained richness and many African tropical forests with disproportionally higher coarse-grained richness. The influence of different climatic, topographic and biogeographical variables on alpha diversity also varies across grains. Our multi-grain maps return a nuanced understanding of vascular plant biodiversity patterns that complements classic maps of biodiversity hotspots and will improve predictions of global change effects on biodiversity.},

            Forest fire activity has increased in recent years in central and south‐central Chile. Drought conditions have been associated with the increase of large wildfires, area burned and longer fire seasons. This study examines the influence of drought on fire regimes and discusses landscape management opportunities to decrease fire hazard. Specifically, we investigate the effect of the 2010–2015 Megadrought (MD) compared to 1990–2009 period on fire activity (fire‐season length, number of fires and burned area across months, fire sizes, regions and vegetation cover types, simultaneity, and duration of fires) in central and south‐central Chile (32°–39° S), using contemporary fire statistics derived from the Chilean Forest Service. For large fire events ({\textgreater}200 ha) the average season length increased by 67 d (44\%), comparing 2010–2015 to 1990–2009. Earlier and later ignition dates resulted in extended fire seasons in MD years. During the MD, the number, area burned, simultaneity, and duration of large fires increased significantly compared to the control period, including the unprecedented occurrence of large fires during winter. The burned area in large fires increased in all vegetation types, during the MD compared to the control period, especially in the exotic plantation cover type. The regions that were most affected by fire (i.e., total area burned) during the MD were Maule, Bío‐Bío, and Araucanía (35–39° S) that concentrate {\textgreater}75\% of forest plantations in Chile. Although both maximum temperatures and precipitation are drivers of fire activity, a simple attribution analysis indicates that the sustained rainfall deficit during 2010–2015 was the most critical factor in the enhanced fire activity. Future climate change predictions indicate more recurrent, intense, and temporally extended droughts for central and south‐central Chile. Under this scenario, land‐use planning and fire and forest management strategies must promote a more diverse and less flammable landscape mosaic limiting high load, homogenous, and continuous exotic plantations.},
